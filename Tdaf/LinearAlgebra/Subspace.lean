# The affine hull of a set containing the origin

A set containing the origin has the same affine hull and linear hull: Mathlib's
`vectorSpan_eq_span_vsub_set_right` subtracts a chosen base point, and when that point can be taken
to be `0` the subtraction disappears. That is `vectorSpan_eq_span_of_zero_mem`, and it is
**Rockafellar, Theorem 1.1** in the form its consumers use it — the affine sets through the origin
are exactly the subspaces. Alongside it, `vectorSpan_eq_of_affineSpan_eq` turns equal affine hulls
into equal directions, hence equal `finrank`. Stated for an arbitrary module over a field; nothing
here is about convexity.
