# Equi-Lipschitz families and convergence of convex functions

Rockafellar's **Theorems 10.6–10.9**: a pointwise bounded family of convex functions on a
relatively open convex set is uniformly bounded and equi-Lipschitzian on compact subsets (10.6); a
function convex in `x` and continuous in `t` is jointly continuous (10.7); pointwise convergence on
a dense subset propagates and becomes uniform on compact subsets (10.8); and a bounded sequence has
a subsequence converging uniformly on compact subsets (10.9).

Each theorem appears twice: an `interior` form, on an **open** convex set, which carries the whole
argument, and a `_relint` form, on `ri C` for an arbitrary convex `C`, obtained from it through the
linear chart of `Continuity.lean`. The hypotheses are Rockafellar's weakened pair (a), (b)
throughout: a subset `C'` with `ri C ⊆ cl C'` on which the family is pointwise bounded above, plus
a single point of `ri C` at which it is bounded below. Taking `C' = ri C` recovers the headline
statements, and Theorems 10.8 and 10.9 *need* the weakened form, their own hypotheses being about
a dense subset.

## Main results

* `exists_forall_abs_le_of_isCompact`, `exists_forall_lipschitzOnWith_of_isCompact` and their
  `_relint` twins — **Theorem 10.6**, with
  `exists_forall_abs_le_and_lipschitzOnWith_of_isCompact_relint` as the headline form for a
  pointwise bounded family. The uniform bound splits into `exists_forall_le_of_isCompact` and
  `exists_forall_ge_of_isBounded`, and `bddAbove_range_of_subset_convexHull_closure` is the step
  that spreads pointwise boundedness off a dense subset.
* `continuousOn_prod_of_convexOn`, `continuousOn_prod_of_convexOn_relint` — **Theorem 10.7**, for
  an arbitrary locally compact `T`.
* `exists_tendstoUniformlyOn_of_dense`, `exists_tendstoUniformlyOn_of_dense_relint` —
  **Theorem 10.8**, with `tendstoUniformlyOn_of_tendsto`(`_relint`) for the case where the limit is
  already known and `eventually_forall_le_add_of_eventually_le`(`_relint`) for
  **Corollary 10.8.1**. `uniformCauchySeqOn_of_dense` is the analytic core.
* `exists_subseq_tendstoUniformlyOn`, `exists_subseq_tendstoUniformlyOn_relint` — **Theorem 10.9**.
* `convexOn_ciSup` — a finite pointwise supremum of convex functions is convex.
* `convexOn_chart`, `mem_relint_of_mem_interior_chart`, `mem_interior_chart_of_mem_relint`,
  `chart_subset_interior_chart`, `interior_chart_subset_closure_chart` — the chart bookkeeping.

## Implementation notes

The functions are real-valued rather than `EReal`-valued: §10.6–10.9 are about families *finite* on
a relatively open convex set, and every conclusion — a supremum, a Lipschitz constant, a uniform
bound, a limit — is a statement about real numbers. So the family is `f : ι → E → ℝ` with
`∀ i, ConvexOn ℝ C (f i)`, which composes directly with Mathlib; a caller holding an
`EReal`-valued `ConvexFn` converts with `ConvexFn.convexOn_toReal_dom`. Rockafellar's hypothesis
(a) actually asks only for `C ⊆ conv (cl C')`, which is what
`bddAbove_range_of_subset_convexHull_closure` proves; the theorems are stated with `cl C'` because
the step from a bound to *uniform* convergence needs points of `C'` metrically near `S`, which a
convex hull does not supply. Theorem 10.9 avoids a diagonal argument: the values on a countable
dense subset live in a compact box in `ℕ → ℝ`, compact by Tychonoff and sequentially compact
because `ℕ → ℝ` is first countable.

retraction `r : E →L[ℝ] V`, and the identity `ri C = x₀ + ι (int (chart C x₀ V))`. The three
lemmas here are the bookkeeping that identity buys. -/
