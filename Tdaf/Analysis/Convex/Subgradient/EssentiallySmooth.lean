# Essential smoothness

A convex function is *essentially smooth* when the interior `C` of its effective domain is
non-empty, `f` is differentiable throughout `C`, and `‖∇f xᵢ‖ → ∞` along every sequence in `C`
approaching a point outside `C`. For a closed proper convex function on a finite-dimensional inner
product space this happens exactly when the subdifferential is single-valued, and in that case
`∂f` is the gradient on `C` and empty elsewhere — so the multivalued object `∂f` carries precisely
the information of the classical gradient mapping. That is what makes the Legendre transformation
work.

## Main results

* `EssentiallySmooth f` — the three conditions above, with the gradient written as
  `fderiv ℝ (fun z => (f z).toReal)`.
* `domSubgradient_eq_interior_dom_of_essentiallySmooth` — `dom ∂f = int (dom f)`.
* `subsingleton_subgradient_iff_essentiallySmooth` — essential smoothness is exactly
  single-valuedness of `∂f` (Theorem 26.1 in [^1]).

## Implementation notes

Condition (c) is stated at every point outside `C`, where the book states it at boundary points of
`C`. Since `C` is open the two readings agree, and this one avoids re-deriving boundaryness at
every use. Gradients are compared through their Riesz representatives, since `∂f x` for the pairing
`innerₗ E` is a set of vectors while `fderiv` lands in `StrongDual ℝ E`.

/-- Essential smoothness. Writing `C = int (dom f)`: (a) `C` is non-empty, (b) `f` is
differentiable throughout `C`, and (c) `‖∇f xᵢ‖ → ∞` for every sequence in `C` converging to a
point outside `C`. A finite differentiable convex function on the whole space is essentially
smooth, (c) holding vacuously. -/

subsequence of gradients would converge to a subgradient at the limit point. -/
