# Where a convex function is differentiable

The continuity theory of one-sided derivatives, read as an existence theory for derivatives. A
convex function on the line has a two-sided derivative off a countable set, and that derivative is
continuous and nondecreasing there. In a fixed direction `y`, the two-sided directional derivative
exists exactly where `x ↦ f'(x; y)` is continuous, and that happens on a dense subset of
`int (dom f)`.

## Main results

* `continuousAt_rightDeriv_iff` — a continuity criterion: `f'₊` is continuous at `x` exactly when
  `f'₋(x) = f'₊(x)`.
* `countable_leftDeriv_ne_rightDeriv` — the jump set of `f'₊` is countable.
* `differentiableAtFn_iff_leftDeriv_eq_rightDeriv` — on the line, differentiability at an interior
  point of `dom f` *is* the equality of the two one-sided derivatives.
* `countable_not_differentiableAtFn`, `continuousAt_rightDeriv_of_differentiableAtFn`,
  `subset_closure_differentiableAtFn` — a countable exceptional set, continuity of the derivative
  where it exists, and density of the points of differentiability (Theorem 25.3 in [^1]).
* `continuousAt_dirDeriv_iff`, `subset_closure_twoSided_dirDeriv` — the same in a fixed direction
  (Theorem 25.4 in [^1]).

## Implementation notes

`rightDeriv f` is defined on the whole line, not only on the set `D` where the derivative exists,
so the continuity assertions here are the ordinary `ContinuousAt`, stronger than the book's
"continuous relative to `D`". Monotonicity is likewise global.

Three of the classical hypotheses are absent. The countability and density clauses need no
closedness of `f`, because only the easy half of the continuity criterion is used; closedness
enters only in the converse, through the one-sided limit formulas for `f'₊`. The directional form
needs no `y ≠ 0`, since at `y = 0` both sides hold, and its density clause is proved by restricting
to a line rather than through Lebesgue measure, so it needs no finite-dimensionality.

`f'₊(z) → ⨆ {f'₊(z) | z < x}` as `z ↑ x`, continuity identifies that supremum with `f'₊(x)`, and
every `f'₊(z)` with `z < x` lies below `f'₋(x)`. Unlike the converse this needs no closedness. -/
