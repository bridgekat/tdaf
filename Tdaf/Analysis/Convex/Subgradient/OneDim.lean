# One-sided derivatives of a convex function on the line

On the line a convex function has a right derivative `f'₊` and a left derivative `f'₋` at every
point, with values in `[-∞, +∞]`, and they carry all the first-order information:

```
∂f(x) = {x* ∈ ℝ | f'₋(x) ≤ x* ≤ f'₊(x)}.
```

Both are **nondecreasing**, interlaced as

```
f'₊(z₁) ≤ f'₋(x) ≤ f'₊(x) ≤ f'₋(z₂)          for z₁ < x < z₂,
```

both are real exactly on `int (dom f)`, and — when `f` is closed — each is the one-sided limit of
the other:

```
lim_{z ↓ x} f'₊(z) = lim_{z ↓ x} f'₋(z) = f'₊(x),
lim_{z ↑ x} f'₊(z) = lim_{z ↑ x} f'₋(z) = f'₋(x).
```

So `f'₊` is right-continuous, `f'₋` is left-continuous, and either one determines the other. In
consequence any nondecreasing `φ` with `f'₋ ≤ φ ≤ f'₊` determines `∂f`, and hence determines `f`
itself up to an additive constant.

One dimension also collapses the two monotonicity notions of `Subgradient/Monotone.lean` into one.
A monotone relation on `ℝ` is exactly a set totally ordered by the coordinatewise order of `ℝ × ℝ`
— a *non-decreasing curve* — and any cycle through such a set may be rotated to start at its
largest pair, which dominates the cycle in both coordinates and may therefore be deleted without
decreasing the telescoping sum. So monotone and cyclically monotone agree on the line, and the
maximal monotone relations — the *complete non-decreasing curves* — are precisely the graphs of the
subdifferentials of the closed proper convex functions.

## Main definitions

* `rightDeriv f x`, `leftDeriv f x` — the two one-sided derivatives, extended by `+∞` to the right
  of `dom f` and by `-∞` to its left.
* `cycleVal B L` — the telescoping sum around the cycle through a list `L` of pairs, a repackaging
  of `chainVal` that makes rotation invariance expressible.

## Main results

* `leftDeriv_le_rightDeriv`, `rightDeriv_le_leftDeriv`, `monotone_rightDeriv`,
  `monotone_leftDeriv` — the interlacing chain and monotonicity.
* `rightDeriv_lt_top_iff`, `bot_lt_leftDeriv_iff`,
  `bot_lt_leftDeriv_and_rightDeriv_lt_top_iff` — finiteness, and its identification with
  interiority of `dom f`.
* `mem_subgradient_iff_le_rightDeriv` — `∂f(x)` is the interval `[f'₋(x), f'₊(x)]`.
* `iInf_rightDeriv_Ioi`, `iSup_leftDeriv_Iio`, `iInf_leftDeriv_Ioi`, `iSup_rightDeriv_Iio` and
  their `Tendsto` forms `tendsto_rightDeriv_nhdsWithin_Ioi` and companions — the four limit
  formulas, for a closed proper convex `f`.
* `iInf_Ioi_eq_rightDeriv`, `iSup_Iio_eq_leftDeriv` — a nondecreasing `φ` between `f'₋` and `f'₊`
  has the same one-sided limits.
* `exists_eq_add_coe_of_deriv_eq`, `exists_eq_add_coe_of_le_le` — two closed proper convex
  functions with the same one-sided derivatives, or squeezed around a common `φ`, differ by a
  constant.
* `tendsto_nhdsWithin_Ioi_of_monotone`, `tendsto_nhdsWithin_Iio_of_monotone` — the general fact
  that a monotone map into a complete linear order has one-sided limits, equal to the obvious
  infimum and supremum.
* `cycleVal_append_comm` — the sum around a cycle is invariant under rotation.
* `isMonotoneRel_iff_forall_le_or_le`, `IsMonotoneRel.isCyclicallyMonotone`,
  `isMaximalMonotoneRel_iff_isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone` — on the line, monotone means totally
  ordered, and coincides with cyclically monotone.
* `isMaximalMonotoneRel_iff_exists_closedProperConvexFn` — the maximal monotone relations on `ℝ`
  are exactly the subdifferentials of the closed proper convex functions, and
  `mem_subgradientRel_iff` describes each of them as the region between two one-sided derivatives.

## Design notes

**The two definitions are guarded infima and suprema.** `f'₊(x)` is `f'(x; 1)` *provided* some
point of `dom f` lies to the right of `x`, and `+∞` otherwise; the guard is written
`⨅ _ : ∃ z > x, f z < ⊤, f'(x; 1)`, which is the guarded value on one branch and `⊤` on the other.
It is genuinely needed: where `f x = ⊤` every difference quotient is `⊤ - ⊤ = ⊥`, so the unguarded
infimum would be `-∞` on *both* sides of `dom f`, whereas the two sides must be told apart. Where
`f` is finite the guard is inert (`rightDeriv_eq_dirDeriv`).

**`f'₊` is `f'(x; 1)` and `f'₋` is `-f'(x; -1)`**, so the whole theory of `dirDeriv` from §23 —
monotone difference quotients, convexity, the link with `∂f` — is available and nothing is
redefined. The sign in `f'₋` is because the increment `z - x` is negative there.

**The limit formulas need `f` closed and nothing else.** They fail for
`f = 1 at 0, 0 on (0, ∞), ⊤ on (-∞, 0)`, which is convex and proper but not closed: `f'₊` jumps at
`0`. The proof is Rockafellar's: a real `μ` below every `f'₊(z)`, `z > x`, bounds `f` above by an
affine function of slope `μ` on the segment approaching `x`, and closedness (Corollary 7.5.1)
carries that bound to `x` itself.

**Cycles are lists, and rotation is `cycleVal_append_comm`.** `IsCyclicallyMonotone` presents a
cycle as a head pair `s` and a list `l`, which is the convenient form for the potential
construction but not for rotating. `cycleVal B L = chainVal B p l p.1` for `L = p :: l` puts the
cycle in a single list, and then `cycleVal B (A ++ C) = cycleVal B (C ++ A)` is a two-line
induction on `A` from the one-step case `cycleVal B (p :: l) = cycleVal B (l ++ [p])`.

**Deleting a pair from a cycle needs the sharpened affineness lemma.** `exists_chainVal_eq` says a
chain is an affine function `⟨x, y⟩ - c` of its free endpoint; to see that the edge left behind
when the head is deleted has the right sign, one needs `y` to be the second coordinate of a pair
*of the cycle*, which is `exists_chainVal_eq_mem`.

**Monotonicity is cheaper than it looks.** `f'₊(y) ≤ f'₋(z)` for `y < z` needs only properness:
`dirDeriv` is an *infimum* of difference quotients, and the two quotients across `[y, z]` bound it
whatever `f` is. Convexity enters only in `f'₋(x) ≤ f'₊(x)` at a single point.

## What is not here

**The construction of `f` from `φ` by integration**, `f(x) = ∫ₐˣ φ(t) dt`: given a nondecreasing
`φ : ℝ → [-∞, +∞]`, exhibiting *some* closed proper convex `f` with `f'₋ ≤ φ ≤ f'₊`. It needs the
integral of a nondecreasing `[-∞, +∞]`-valued function, improper at the two ends of the interval
where `φ` is finite, together with the fact that the resulting function is closed there —
real-analysis machinery the project does not have. The uniqueness half of that statement is proved
here and does not go through the integral at all: it goes through `∂f = ∂g` and the rigidity
theorem of `Subgradient/Monotone.lean`. Nor is the integral needed for the description of the
complete non-decreasing curves, which comes instead from maximal monotonicity together with the
identification of the maximal cyclically monotone relations.
