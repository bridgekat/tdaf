# The subdifferential reconstructed from the gradient mapping

Rockafellar's **Theorem 25.6**: for a closed proper convex `f` whose effective domain has interior,

```
∂f x = cl (conv (S x)) + N_{dom f}(x)      for every x,
```

where `S x` is the set of limits of gradients `∇f xᵢ` at points of differentiability `xᵢ → x`.
Every subgradient, at a boundary point of `dom f` as much as at an interior one, is therefore
assembled out of honest gradients and normal directions.

## Main definitions

* `gradientLimits f x` — Rockafellar's `S (x)`, as a set of *vectors*: the limits of sequences of
  gradients taken at points of differentiability tending to `x`. Gradients are vectors here rather
  than functionals because `∂f x` is a set of vectors for the pairing `innerₗ E`.

## Main results

* `gradientLimits_subset_subgradient` — `S x ⊆ ∂f x`, by closedness of the graph of `∂f`
  (Theorem 24.4).
* `containsNoLine_subgradient` — `∂f x` contains no line, when `dom f` has interior.
* `recessionCone_subgradient_subset_normalCone` — a direction of recession of `∂f x` is normal to
  `dom f` at `x`.
* `recessionCone_subgradient_eq_normalCone` — the equality of the two cones, the exercise of
  p. 218. Nothing below uses it; see the design note.
* `exists_mem_interior_dom_of_forall_normalCone` — the separation step: a direction making an
  obtuse angle with every non-zero normal to `dom f` at `x` reaches `int (dom f)`.
* `exposedPoints_subset_gradientLimits` — the heart of the proof: every exposed point of `∂f x` is
  a limit of gradients.
* `subgradient_eq_closure_convexHull_gradientLimits_add_normalCone` — **Theorem 25.6**.

## Design notes

**The recession cone of `∂f x` never has to be computed.** Rockafellar identifies `N_{dom f}(x)`
with the recession cone of `∂f x` and uses the identification three times: to see that `∂f x`
contains no lines, to place extreme directions in the normal cone, and to bound `⟨y, y*⟩` for
normals `y*`. Each of those follows more cheaply from one *inclusion*,
`∂f x + N_{dom f}(x) ⊆ ∂f x` (`subgradient_add_normalCone_dom_subset`, already in
`Subgradient/Calculus.lean`), together with a "let `λ → ∞` in the subgradient inequality" argument
that is the same three lines every time. `containsNoLine_subgradient` and
`recessionCone_subgradient_subset_normalCone` are those arguments, and the equality of the two
cones is never needed *here*.

Rockafellar nevertheless leaves that equality as an exercise in §23 and says its verification
"will be given later as part of the proof of Theorem 25.6" — which, by the paragraph above, is not
where it happens. `recessionCone_subgradient_eq_normalCone` discharges it directly instead: the
missing inclusion is `∂f x + N_{dom f}(x) ⊆ ∂f x` read at a single normal direction, so the
exercise costs four lines and no part of Theorem 25.6.

**The separation step is `geometric_hahn_banach_open`, not Theorem 11.3.** Rockafellar deduces from
"the half-line `{x + αy}` cannot be separated from `dom f`" that it meets `int (dom f)`, citing
Theorem 11.3 and then Theorem 6.1. What the argument needs is only the contrapositive: if the
half-line misses the open convex set `int (dom f)`, Hahn–Banach separates them, and the separating
functional is a non-zero normal `y*` at `x` with `⟨y, y*⟩ ≥ 0`. That is Mathlib's
`geometric_hahn_banach_open` applied directly, and it avoids proper separation altogether.

**The exposed point is where Theorem 25.5 and Theorem 24.6 meet.** Exposedness of `x*` by `y`
gives `⟨y, y*⟩ < 0` for every non-zero normal `y*`, hence a ray from `x` into `int (dom f)`;
Theorem 25.5 supplies points of differentiability arbitrarily close to that ray — within `ε²` of
`x + ε y`, so that the *direction* of approach still converges to `y` — and Theorem 24.6 collapses
the subdifferentials along such an approach onto the face of `∂f x` exposed by `y`, which is the
single point `x*`.

**The functional exposing `x*` may be zero, and then the argument degenerates helpfully.** A zero
functional exposes `x*` exactly when `∂f x = {x*}`, and then Theorem 25.1's converse
(`hasGradientAt_of_subgradient_eq_singleton`) says `f` is differentiable at `x` itself, so `x*`
is a limit of gradients along the constant sequence. There is no ray to build in that case, which
is fortunate, since there is no direction to build it in.

verification "will be given later as part of the proof of Theorem 25.6". **It is not.** The proof

because each of the three places Rockafellar appeals to the identification follows more cheaply
from `∂f x + N_{dom f}(x) ⊆ ∂f x` — see the design note above. So the exercise is discharged here,
on its own and independently of Theorem 25.6, and the other inclusion is exactly that containment

/-- **Theorem 25.6**, the substantive step: an exposed point of `∂f x` is a limit of
gradients.

If the functional exposing `x*` is zero the subdifferential is the single point `x*`, and Theorem
25.1's converse makes `f` differentiable at `x` itself. Otherwise its Riesz representative `y`,
normalised, makes a strictly obtuse angle with every non-zero normal to `dom f` at `x`, so the ray
`x + α y` enters `int (dom f)`; Theorem 25.5 supplies points of differentiability approaching `x`
in the direction `y`, and Theorem 24.6 collapses their subdifferentials onto the face of `∂f x`
exposed by `y`, which is `{x*}`. -/

/-- **Theorem 25.6**: for a closed proper convex function whose effective domain has
interior, the subdifferential at *any* point is reconstructed from the gradient mapping,

```
∂f x = cl (conv S(x)) + N_{dom f}(x),
```

where `S(x)` is the set of limits of gradients at points of differentiability tending to `x`.

The inclusion `⊇` is closedness and convexity of `∂f x` together with
`∂f x + N_{dom f}(x) ⊆ ∂f x`. The inclusion `⊆` is Theorem 18.5 — `∂f x` contains no lines, so it
is the convex hull of its extreme points and extreme directions — with Straszewicz's Theorem 18.6
carrying the extreme points into the closure of the exposed ones, which
`exposedPoints_subset_gradientLimits` places in `S(x)`, and
`recessionCone_subgradient_subset_normalCone` carrying the extreme directions into the normal
cone. -/
