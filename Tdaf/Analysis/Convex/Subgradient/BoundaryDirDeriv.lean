# Condition (c) of essential smoothness, in directional-derivative form

**Lemma 26.2**: given conditions (a) and (b) of essential smoothness, condition (c) — the norms of
the gradients blow up at the boundary of `C = int (dom f)` — may be replaced by

```
(c')  f'(x + λ(a − x); a − x) ↓ −∞ as λ ↓ 0,   for every a ∈ C and every x ∉ C.
```

Both say the same thing at a single point `x`, namely that `∂f x = ∅`: (c) by Theorems 24.4 and
25.6, and (c') by Theorem 23.3 read through the restriction of `f` to the line through `x` and `a`
(Theorem 24.1). Those two halves are separate theorems below, so either can be used on its own.

## Main results

* `closedProperConvexFn_lineRestrict` — the restriction of a closed proper convex function to a
  line is closed proper convex, based at *any* point of the line, not only a point of `dom f`.
* `rightDeriv_lineRestrict_eq_dirDeriv` — `g'₊(t) = f'(x + t y; y)` for the restriction `g`, valid
  also where `g t = ⊤` (both sides are `−∞` there).
* `tendsto_dirDeriv_lineRestrict` — **Theorem 24.1** along the segment.
* `subgradient_eq_empty_iff_tendsto_dirDeriv`, `subgradient_eq_empty_iff_tendsto_norm_fderiv` —
  conditions (c') and (c) at `x` each say that `∂f x = ∅`.
* `essentiallySmooth_iff_tendsto_dirDeriv` — **Lemma 26.2**.

## Implementation notes

`f` is assumed closed, where the book says "without loss of generality" and replaces `f` by `cl f`.
Every consumer of the lemma already carries `ClosedFn f`, because Theorems 24.4 and 25.6 do.

Condition (c') is stated as a `Tendsto` to `𝓝 ⊥`. The book's `↓` also records that
`λ ↦ f'(x + λ(a − x); a − x)` is nondecreasing — that is `monotone_rightDeriv` for the restriction
— but the content of (c') is the value of the limit, which is all the equivalence uses.

sides are `−∞` where `f (x + t y) = ⊤`, so the only hypothesis needed is that the line meets
