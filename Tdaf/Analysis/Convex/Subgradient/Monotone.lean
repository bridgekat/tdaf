# Monotonicity of the subdifferential

The subdifferential of a proper convex function is not merely *monotone* —
`⟨x₁ - x₂, y₁ - y₂⟩ ≥ 0` whenever `yᵢ ∈ ∂f xᵢ` — but **cyclically monotone**: every finite cycle
`(x₀, y₀), (x₁, y₁), …, (x_m, y_m)` in the graph satisfies

```
⟨x₁ - x₀, y₀⟩ + ⟨x₂ - x₁, y₁⟩ + ⋯ + ⟨x₀ - x_m, y_m⟩ ≤ 0.
```

Cyclic monotonicity is the whole story. A multivalued mapping is contained in the subdifferential
of a closed proper convex function exactly when it is cyclically monotone, and the function can be
written down: it is the supremum of the telescoping sums above, read as affine functions of a free
endpoint. Sharpening "contained in" to "equal to" needs a *rigidity* statement in the other
direction — a closed proper convex function is determined by its subdifferential up to an additive
constant — and the two together identify the maximal cyclically monotone mappings as precisely the
subdifferentials.

The rigidity statement is proved here by subdivision. Along a segment in `ri (dom f)` cut into `N`
equal steps, each step contributes the same increment to `f` and to `g` up to an error controlled
by one subgradient difference; telescoping the `N` steps leaves an error of order `1/N`, so the
increments agree exactly. Two functions with the same increments on `ri (dom f)` differ by a
constant there, and closedness propagates the identity to all of `E`.

## Main definitions

* `chainVal B s l x` — Rockafellar's telescoping sum along the chain that starts at `s`, runs
  through the list `l`, and ends at `x`.
* `IsMonotoneRel B ρ`, `IsMaximalMonotoneRel B ρ`, `IsCyclicallyMonotone B ρ`,
  `IsMaximalCyclicallyMonotone B ρ`.
* `cyclicPotential B ρ s` — the function Rockafellar constructs in Theorem 24.8.

## Main results

* `IsCyclicallyMonotone.isMonotoneRel` — cyclic monotonicity implies monotonicity (the case of a
  two-element cycle), and `isMonotoneRel_subgradientRel` is the classical monotonicity of `∂f`.
* `isCyclicallyMonotone_subgradientRel` — **Theorem 24.8**, necessity: `∂f` is cyclically monotone
  for every proper `f`.
* `exists_convexFn_subgradientRel_of_isCyclicallyMonotone`,
  `isCyclicallyMonotone_iff_exists_convexFn` — **Theorem 24.8**, sufficiency and the full
  equivalence.
* `exists_eq_subgradientRel_of_isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone` — **Theorem 24.9**, the half that
  follows from Theorem 24.8: a maximal cyclically monotone mapping *is* a subdifferential.
* `isClosed_subgradientRel` — **Theorem 24.4**: the graph of `∂f` is closed.
* `abs_sub_increment_le` — the subdivision estimate: if `∂f ⊆ ∂g`, the increments of `f` and of `g`
  along `N` equal steps of a common displacement `d` differ by at most `⟨d, y_N - y_0⟩`.
* `increment_eq_of_subgradientRel_subset` — the increments of `f` and `g` between two points of
  `ri (dom f)` coincide.
* `eq_add_coe_of_subgradientRel_subset` — **rigidity**: `∂f ⊆ ∂g` forces `g = f + α` for a real
  constant `α` (**Theorem 24.9**, uniqueness).
* `isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone_subgradientRel` and
  `isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone_iff_exists_closedProperConvexFn` — **Theorem 24.9** in full: `∂f` is
  maximal cyclically monotone, and maximal cyclic monotonicity characterises subdifferentials.
* `conj_add_coe`, `subgradient_add_coe`, `subgradientRel_add_coe` — the effect of an additive
  constant on the conjugate and on the subdifferential.

## Design notes

**Cycles are lists, not `Fin (m+1)`-indexed families.** Rockafellar writes a cycle as a finite
sequence of pairs; `chainVal` is the same object defined by recursion on a `List (E × F)`, with the
starting pair carried separately so that the recursion step is literally "walk one edge and
recurse". Every proof in the section is then a list induction: the telescoping estimate
`le_of_chain_mem_subgradientRel`, the append lemma `chainVal_append_singleton` that adds the last
edge of the cycle, and the affineness lemma `exists_chainVal_eq` that makes `cyclicPotential` a
supremum of affine functions. A `Fin`-indexed statement would need `Finset.sum_equiv` along
`i ↦ i + 1` for the telescoping and would gain nothing.

**`chainVal B s l x` has the free endpoint last.** That is what makes `cyclicPotential` a supremum
of affine functions of `x` (`exists_chainVal_eq`: `chainVal B s l x = ⟨x, y⟩ - c` for a `(y, c)`
depending only on `s` and `l`), and it makes the cycle condition read
`chainVal B s l s.1 ≤ 0` — "come back to where you started".

**Theorem 24.4 asks for joint continuity of the pairing.** `IsContinuousPairing B` gives continuity
of `⟨·, y⟩` for each fixed `y`, which is not enough to pass to the limit in `⟨z - xᵢ, yᵢ⟩` when both
arguments move. In `ℝⁿ` the hypothesis is automatic; here it is an explicit
`Continuous fun p : E × F => B p.1 p.2`.

## What is not here

**Local boundedness of `∂f`** lives in `Tdaf.Analysis.Convex.Subgradient.Bounded`, which imports
this file.

**Maximal *monotonicity* of `∂f`** (Corollary 31.5.2) is `isMaximalMonotoneRel_subgradientRel` in
`Tdaf.Analysis.Convex.Optimization.Prox`, aliased as `subgradient_maximalMonotone`. It cannot live
here: its proof is Moreau's theorem, and `Optimization/Prox.lean` imports this file. What *is* here
is the maximal **cyclic** monotonicity of Theorem 24.9, and line 9631 of Rockafellar warns
explicitly that neither implies the other.

**The one-dimensional theory is absent**: the description of the subdifferential of a closed proper
convex function on `ℝ` as a complete nondecreasing curve, and the recovery of the function from that
curve by integration. It needs one-sided derivatives `f'₊`, `f'₋` for `EReal`-valued functions on
`ℝ` — including the conventions `f'₊ = +∞` past the right end of `dom f` and `f'₋ = -∞` before its
left end, which are *not* the values `dirDeriv` takes there — together with a theory of the integral
of a monotone `[-∞, +∞]`-valued function. Neither is in the project.

**Convergence of subgradients** (`∂fᵢ → ∂f` for a pointwise-convergent sequence of finite convex
functions, and the corresponding statement for one-sided directional derivatives) is also absent;
see the discussion in `Tdaf.Analysis.Convex.Subgradient.Bounded`.

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 24.4**: the graph of `∂f` is a closed subset of `E × F`. Equivalently,
`xᵢ* ∈ ∂f xᵢ`, `xᵢ → x` and `xᵢ* → x*` force `x* ∈ ∂f x`.

Convexity of `f` is not used. Lower semicontinuity is, and so is joint continuity of the pairing:
the subgradient inequality at `xᵢ` involves `⟨z - xᵢ, xᵢ*⟩`, where both arguments move. -/

/-- **The chain estimate that proves Theorem 24.9's uniqueness clause.** Along a chain of equally
spaced points `x 0, x 1, …, x N` with common step `d`, where `v i` is a subgradient of `f` at
`x i` and `∂f ⊆ ∂g`, the increments of `f` and of `g` across the chain differ by at most
`⟨d, v N - v 0⟩`.

The two increments are trapped between the *same* two telescoping sums — the subgradients of `f`
serve `g` as well — so their difference is majorised by the total variation of the chain of
subgradients, which telescopes to `⟨d, v N⟩ - ⟨d, v 0⟩`. Halving the step halves the bound while
leaving the two ends of the chain alone, and that is what forces the two increments to agree. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 24.9**, the analytic core: if `∂f ⊆ ∂g` then `f` and `g` have the *same
increments* between relative interior points of `dom f`.

Rockafellar deduces this from the one-dimensional theory of §24.1–24.3, integrating the common
one-sided derivative along the segment. The argument here is elementary and needs none of it.
Subdivide `[x₁, x₂]` into `N` equal steps and pick a subgradient `v i ∈ ∂f (x i)` at each node,
keeping the two ends fixed. Each step traps both increments in the interval
`[⟨d, v i⟩, ⟨d, v (i+1)⟩]`, so the two increments differ by at most the telescoping total
`⟨d, v N - v 0⟩ = N⁻¹ ⟨x₂ - x₁, v N - v 0⟩`, which tends to `0`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 24.9**, uniqueness clause: a closed proper convex function is determined
by its subdifferential up to an additive constant, and already by the *inclusion* `∂f ⊆ ∂g`.

The proof follows Rockafellar. `exists_forall_le_add_coe_of_subgradientRel_subset` gives `g ≤ f + α`
with equality on `cl (dom f)`; Corollary 23.5.1 turns `∂f ⊆ ∂g` into `∂f* ⊆ ∂g*` and repeats the
argument on the conjugate side, giving `g* ≤ f* + β` with equality on `cl (dom f*)`. Evaluating
Theorem 23.5 (d) at a pair `(x, y)` of the graph of `∂f` — where both equalities apply — forces
`β = -α`, so `g* ≤ (f + α)*`; conjugating that back and using Fenchel–Moreau gives `g ≥ f + α`. -/

of a closed proper convex function is a *maximal* cyclically monotone mapping.

If `∂f ⊆ σ` with `σ` cyclically monotone then Theorem 24.8 puts `σ ⊆ ∂g` for some closed proper
convex `g`; the uniqueness clause makes `g = f + α`, and a constant does not change a
subdifferential (`subgradientRel_add_coe`), so `σ ⊆ ∂f`. -/
