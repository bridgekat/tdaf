# Internal representation of a closed convex set

The second half of Rockafellar's §18: the theorems that recover a closed convex set from its
extremal structure. `Face.lean` supplies the faces themselves (Theorems 18.1 and 18.2), and
`HullDirections.lean` supplies `convexHullPD`, the convex hull of a set of points together with a
set of directions, which is what "`C = conv S`" means once `S` may contain directions.

## Main definitions

* `ContainsNoLine C` — no line is contained in `C`; Rockafellar's "`C` contains no lines", i.e.
  lineality zero.
* `IsExtremeDirection C y` — the direction of `y` is an *extreme direction* of `C`: some closed
  half-line in the direction of `y` is a face of `C`. `extremeDirections C` is the set of such `y`.
* `IsAffineHalf C` — `C` is an affine set or a closed half of one: the intersection of `aff C`
  with a closed half-space. The degenerate functional `0` makes the affine case a special case, so
  the two exceptional sets in Theorem 18.4 become a single predicate.

## Main results

* `exists_notMem_relint_mem_segment_of_not_isAffineHalf` — **Theorem 18.4** in general: in a
  closed convex set that is not an affine set or a closed half of one, every relative interior
  point lies on a segment joining two relative boundary points. The analytic core is
  `exists_notMem_relint_mem_segment_of_isBounded` (a bounded line section has both endpoints in
  the relative boundary), the geometric input is
  `exists_notMem_relint_mem_segment_of_not_convex` (a non-convex relative boundary produces a
  direction whose line sections are bounded, by Corollary 8.4.1), and
  `isAffineHalf_of_convex_sdiff_relint` is the classification that identifies the exceptions.
* `convexHullPD_extremePoints_extremeDirections` — **Theorem 18.5**, the Minkowski–Klee
  representation: a closed convex set containing no lines is the convex hull of its extreme points
  and extreme directions. `extremePoints_nonempty_of_containsNoLine` is **Corollary 18.5.3** and
  `coneHull_extremeDirections_eq` is **Corollary 18.5.2**. **Corollary 18.5.1**, Minkowski's
  theorem for compact sets, is `convexHull_extremePoints` in `Face.lean`, proved earlier and used
  here as the base case of the induction.
* `IsFace.eq_convexHullPD` — **Theorem 18.3**: a nonempty face of `conv S` is the hull of the
  points of `S` it contains and the directions of `S` in which it recedes.
  `extremePoints_convexHullPD_subset` and `exists_mem_eq_smul_of_mem_extremeDirections` are the
  two halves of **Corollary 18.3.1**: an extreme point of `conv S` is a point of `S`, and — when
  no half-line meets the points of `S` in an unbounded set — an extreme direction of `conv S` is
  the direction of a vector of `S`.
* `extremePoints_subset_closure_exposedPoints` — **Theorem 18.6, Straszewicz's theorem**: the
  exposed points of a closed convex set are dense in its extreme points. `Mathlib` does not have
  this. `mem_exposedPoints_of_forall_norm_sub_le` is the geometric heart (a farthest point is
  exposed) and `closure_exposedPoints_eq_closure_extremePoints` is the symmetric restatement.

## What is not here

* **Theorem 18.7** (a closed convex set containing no lines is the closed hull of its *exposed*
  points and exposed directions), **Corollary 18.7.1** and **Theorem 18.8** (an `n`-dimensional
  closed convex set is the intersection of its tangent closed half-spaces). There is no definition
  of an *exposed direction* here, only of an extreme one. Rockafellar's proof of 18.7 also turns
  on dimension bookkeeping that nothing in this project supports yet: an `(n-2)`-dimensional
  affine set inside a supporting hyperplane meeting `C ∩ H` only at one point, and the deduction
  that the resulting exposed face is one-dimensional. Extending that affine set to a hyperplane
  missing `int C` is Rockafellar's Theorem 11.2, and that *is* available, as
  `exists_separates_of_isOpen_of_disjoint_affine` in `Separation.lean`. Theorem 18.8 needs 18.7
  applied to the epigraph of the support function, so it is blocked behind 18.7.

## Design notes

**`IsAffineHalf` merges two of Rockafellar's cases.** He excludes "affine sets" and "closed halves
of affine sets" separately in Theorem 18.4. Allowing the functional in the definition to vanish
identically makes the affine case the case `φ = 0`, so the hypothesis of Theorem 18.4 is the single
negation `¬ IsAffineHalf C`.

**Theorem 18.3 avoids Rockafellar's Theorem 6.4.** He puts the point of the face in the relative
interior of the hull of the vectors actually used in one of its representations — which needs the
positive-coefficient description of `ri (conv S)`, a §6 result this project does not have — and
then applies Theorem 18.1. Here the point part is handled by
`IsExtreme.mem_convexHull_inter`, which splits `P` into the part inside the face and the part
outside and uses only the definition of an extreme set, and the direction part by
`IsFace.mem_recessionCone_of_eq_add_smul`, an induction over the cone hull. Only Theorem 8.3 and
Corollary 18.1.1 are needed, both of which are available.

**Theorem 18.5 avoids Rockafellar's "trivial" case analysis.** The induction here splits on
`finrank ℝ (vectorSpan ℝ C)`: dimension `≤ 1` is settled by `exists_eq_halfLine`, which classifies
an unbounded one-dimensional line-free closed convex set as a closed half-line, and the bounded
case in every dimension is settled by Minkowski's theorem, already available from `Face.lean`.
Only the unbounded case of dimension `≥ 2` uses Theorem 18.4 together with Theorem 18.2.

**Straszewicz is proved in a Euclidean space and transported.** The farthest-point construction is
genuinely inner-product geometry, so `section Euclidean` assumes `[InnerProductSpace ℝ E]`; the
public statements are then obtained for an arbitrary finite-dimensional real normed space by
pushing the set through `toEuclidean`, using `image_extremePoints` from `Mathlib` and
`image_exposedPoints` proved here. `mem_exposedPoints_of_forall_norm_sub_le` stays in the
inner-product layer, since its content is metric.

/-- **An extreme set absorbs the vertices of a convex combination it contains.** If `u` lies in an
extreme subset `C'` of `C` and is a convex combination of points of `P ⊆ C`, then `u` is already a
convex combination of those points of `P` that lie in `C'`.

This is the mechanism behind Rockafellar's Theorem 18.3. His proof instead puts `u` in the
relative interior of the hull of the points actually used and appeals to Theorem 18.1; splitting
`P` into the part inside `C'` and the part outside avoids that, and avoids Theorem 6.4 with it. -/

closed set `C`, in a direction `d` of the affine hull of `C`, meets `C` in a bounded set, then `x`
lies on a segment joining two points of `C` that are not relative interior points: the two ends of

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 18.4**, in the form the proof produces: if the relative boundary of a
closed convex set `C` is *not convex*, then every relative interior point of `C` lies on a segment
joining two relative boundary points.

Rockafellar's own hypothesis — that `C` is neither an affine set nor a closed half of an affine
set — is equivalent to this one; see `exists_notMem_relint_mem_segment_of_not_isAffineHalf`.

The proof is his: non-convexity of the relative boundary produces two relative boundary points
`p ≠ q` whose segment meets `ri C`, the line through them meets `C` in exactly that segment
(Theorem 6.1), so every parallel line meets `C` in a bounded set (**Corollary 8.4.1**), and the
analytic core does the rest. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 18.5**: a closed convex set containing no lines is the convex hull of
its extreme points and extreme directions.

The proof is his induction on `dim C`: for a set of dimension at least two the relative boundary
is not convex (Theorem 18.4 through `not_containsNoLine_of_isAffineHalf`), so every relative
interior point lies on a segment joining two relative boundary points, and each relative boundary
point lies in the relative interior of a face of strictly smaller dimension (Theorem 18.2), which
is again closed (Corollary 18.1.1) and contains no lines. Dimensions `0` and `1` are the base
cases: a bounded set is handled by Minkowski's theorem and an unbounded one is a closed
half-line. -/

section Euclidean

variable {E : Type*} [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E] {C : Set E}

/-- **A farthest point is an exposed point.** If `p ∈ C` maximises the distance to `y` over `C`,
then `p` is an exposed point of `C`: the linear functional `⟪p - y, ·⟫` attains its maximum over
`C` at `p` and nowhere else.

Geometrically, the sphere about `y` through `p` contains `C`, and the tangent hyperplane to that
sphere at `p` meets it only at `p`. Neither convexity nor closedness of `C` is needed.

This is the second half of Rockafellar's proof of Theorem 18.6. -/
