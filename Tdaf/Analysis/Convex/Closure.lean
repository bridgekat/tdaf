# Closures of convex functions

Two operations on functions `f : E → EReal` over a real topological vector space: the lower
semicontinuous hull `lscHull f`, whose epigraph is `closure (epi f)`, and the *closure* `clFn f` of
a convex function, which is that hull except that it is flattened to the constant `⊥` when the hull
takes the value `⊥` anywhere.

## Main definitions

* `lscHull f` — the lower semicontinuous hull, `ofEpi (closure (epi f))`.
* `clFn f` — the closure of a convex function.
* `ClosedFn f` — `f` is closed, i.e. `clFn f = f`.
* `ClosedProperConvexFn f` — closed, proper *and* convex, bundled; the standing hypothesis of the
  duality theory, and the class `conjEquiv` and `supportEquiv` are bijections between.
* `lscHullClosure`, `clFnClosure` — both operations as `ClosureOperator`s on `(E → EReal)ᵒᵈ`.

## Main results

* `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_epi`, `lowerSemicontinuous_iff_isClosed_le` —
  lower semicontinuity, closed sublevel sets and a closed epigraph coincide.
* `epi_lscHull` — `epi (lscHull f) = closure (epi f)`, unconditionally; the workhorse of the file.
* `isGreatest_lscHull` — `lscHull f` is the greatest lower semicontinuous minorant of `f`.
* `closedFn_iff` — `f` is closed exactly when it is the constant `⊥`, or lower semicontinuous and
  never `⊥`.
* `iInf_clFn_eq_iInf` — `f` and `cl f` have the same infimum.
* `ConvexFn.eq_bot_or_eq_top` — a lower semicontinuous improper convex function has no finite
  values. This replaces the relative-interior dichotomy outside finite dimensions.
* `exists_affine_le_of_closed_proper` — a closed proper convex function on a locally convex space
  has a continuous affine minorant; the keystone of Fenchel–Moreau.
* `tendsto_lscHull_along_segment`, `tendsto_along_segment_of_closed_proper` — the closure as a
  limit along a segment, with `interior (epi f)` in place of `ri (epi f)`.
* `lscHull_le_setOf` — `{x | (cl f) x ≤ α} = ⋂_{μ > α} cl {f ≤ μ}`, the level sets of the closure,
  in the part that does not need relative interiors.
* `lscHull_eq_liminf`, `clFn_eq_liminf_or` — the hull and the closure as `liminf f (𝓝 x)`.
* `posHomogeneous_lscHull`, `posHomogeneous_clFn` — both hulls preserve positive homogeneity.
* `closedProperConvexFn_coe_affineMap` — a *continuous* affine function is closed proper convex.

## Implementation notes

`clFn` branches on `lscHull f`, not on `f` as Rockafellar does. The two agree for convex `f` on
`ℝⁿ` but not in general, and branching on `f` would make Fenchel–Moreau
false: a discontinuous linear functional `g` on an infinite-dimensional space is convex, finite and
proper, yet its kernel is dense, so `lscHull g ≡ ⊥` and `g` has no continuous affine minorant at
all. Branching on the hull is the standard Γ-regularization and makes `f** = clFn f`
unconditional; the price is that `Proper f → Proper (clFn f)` is finite-dimensional and appears as
`ConvexFn.proper_clFn` in `Tdaf/Analysis/Convex/RelativeInterior.lean`, together with the
relative-interior dichotomy itself.

that is `⊥` at the origin of `ℝ` and `⊤` elsewhere has the vertical line `{0} × ℝ` as its epigraph,
so it is convex and lower semicontinuous, takes the value `⊥`, and is not the constant `⊥`. -/

infinite dimensions — a discontinuous linear functional `g` has dense kernel, so `lscHull g ≡ ⊥`,
while `g` is convex, finite everywhere and proper. The proof separates the closed convex set
`epi f` from the point `(x₀, f x₀ - 1)`; the separating functional cannot be vertical, since a
