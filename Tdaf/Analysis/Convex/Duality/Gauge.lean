# Gauges, polars of convex functions, and obverses

The **gauge** of a set `C` is `γ(x ∣ C) = inf {a ≥ 0 ∣ x ∈ a • C}`: the least dilation of `C` that
swallows `x`, and `+∞` when none does. Gauges are exactly the nonnegative positively homogeneous
convex functions vanishing at `0`, and `C ↦ γ(· ∣ C)` is a bijection from closed convex sets
containing `0` to closed gauges. Three polarity operations act here, each an involution on its
class: the polar `k°(y) = inf {μ ≥ 0 ∣ ⟨x, y⟩ ≤ μ k(x)}` of a gauge, the polar
`f°(y) = inf {μ ≥ 0 ∣ ⟨x, y⟩ ≤ 1 + μ f(x)}` of a nonnegative closed convex `f` with `f 0 = 0`, and
the obverse `fᵒ(x) = inf {λ > 0 ∣ λ f(x / λ) ≤ 1}`. On a gauge the first two agree, and the obverse
ties them to the Fenchel conjugate: `f* = (f°)ᵒ`. Two facts about polar *sets* are proved here too,
because the gauge is what makes them short: the recession cone of a closed convex set containing the
origin is the polar of its polar, and the polar of a sublevel set of a nonnegative convex function
is within a factor of two of the corresponding sublevel set of the conjugate.

## Main definitions

* `gaugeFn C`, `IsGauge k` — the gauge, `EReal`-valued, and its characterising properties.
* `polarGauge B k`, `polarFn B f`, `obverse f` — the three operations above. `polarFn` infimises
  over `epi f`; `polarFn_apply_eq` recovers the book's formula.
* `IsPolarFn f` — nonnegative, closed, convex, `f 0 = 0`: the class `polarFn` inverts.
* `IsNorm k` — a gauge that is finite, symmetric and positive off `0`; `IsNorm.toSeminorm` builds
  the Mathlib `Seminorm`. `AbsorbsAll C` and `RayFree C` make `γ(· ∣ C)` a norm.
* `epiPairing B`, `vNeg X` — the pairing of `E × ℝ` with `F × ℝ`, and vertical reflection.
* `UpClosed S` — upward closed subsets of `ℝ`, the shape of every admissible-scalar set here.

## Main results

* `gaugeEquiv`, `isGauge_iff` — the correspondence `k = γ(· ∣ C)`, `C = {k ≤ 1}`.
* `recessionCone_eq_polarCone_polarSet`, `polarCone_linealitySpace` — the recession cone of `C` is
  the polar of `C°`, and the lineality space of `C` is the annihilator of `C°`;
  `finrank_vectorSpan_polarSet_add_lineality` and its companion read these through `finrank` as
  `dim C° = n - lin C` and `lin C° = n - dim C`. `polarSet_setOf_le_subset_and_subset` traps
  `α⁻¹ {f* ≤ α}` between `{f ≤ α}°` and `2 {f ≤ α}°`.
* `polarGauge_eq_supportFn`, `polarGauge_polarGauge`, `polarGaugeEquiv` — the polar of a gauge is
  the support function of its unit level set, and `k°° = cl k` (Theorem 15.1 in [^1]). `isNorm_iff`
  identifies the norms among the gauges.
* `polarFn_polarFn`, `polarFnEquiv` — `f°° = cl f`, so `f ↦ f°` is an involution on the nonnegative
  closed convex functions vanishing at the origin (Theorem 15.4 in [^1]).
* `obverse_obverse`, `conj_eq_obverse_polarFn`, `polarFn_eq_obverse_conj` — the obverse is an
  involution, and `f°` and `f*` are obverses of each other (Theorem 15.5 in [^1]);
  `polarFn_conj_eq_conj_polarFn` is `f*° = f°*`, and `setOf_polarFn_le` is
  `{f° ≤ α⁻¹} = α⁻¹ {f* ≤ α}`.

## Implementation notes

`gaugeFn` is `EReal`-valued and infimises over `a ≥ 0`, so it is `+∞` off `⋃ a • C`; that is what
makes `{γ ≤ c}` equal `c • C`. Mathlib's `gauge` infimises over `a > 0` into `ℝ` and returns `0`
there instead — the two agree under absorbency (`gaugeFn_eq_gauge`) — while `egauge` is this same
infimum taken in `ℝ≥0∞`, whereas every function in this library is `EReal`-valued.

The book's admissible set for `f°`, `{μ ≥ 0 ∣ ⟨x, y⟩ ≤ 1 + μ f(x) ∀ x}`, is not closed: at `μ = 0`
the convention `0 · (+∞) = 0` imposes `⟨x, y⟩ ≤ 1` where `f x = +∞`, which nearby positive `μ` do
not. Quantifying over `epi f` gives a closed, upward closed set with the same infimum.

## Divergences from the reference

The sublevel-set inclusions are stated for any nonnegative convex `f` with `f 0 ≤ 0`, with no
closedness. `isNorm_iff` uses `AbsorbsAll C` and `RayFree C` where the book has `0 ∈ int C` and `C`
bounded — equivalent readings in `ℝⁿ` — and does not assert that a norm is closed, which the book
obtains from the continuity of a finite convex function on `ℝⁿ`. `gaugeFn_level_one` needs only
nonnegativity, positive homogeneity and `k 0 = 0`, and `gaugeFn_polarSet` (`γ(· ∣ C°) = δ*(· ∣ C)`)
needs only `0 ∈ C`.

/-! ### Infima of upward closed sets of reals

Every definition in this file is an infimum `⨅ a ∈ S, (a : EReal)` of a set `S ⊆ ℝ` of admissible
scalars, and every proof about it needs to convert `⨅ a ∈ S, a ≤ c` into a statement about
membership in `S`. The two lemmas here are that conversion: it is unconditional in the form "every
`d > c` lies in `S`" once `S` is upward closed, and becomes "`c ∈ S`" once `S` is also closed. -/

/-! ### The gauge of a convex set

`γ(x | C) = inf {a ≥ 0 | x ∈ a • C}`. The scalar `0` is admitted, and
`0 • C = {0}` for nonempty `C`, so `γ(0 | C) = 0` for every nonempty `C` — that is what makes a
gauge vanish at the origin even when `C` does not contain it. -/

A **gauge** is a nonnegative positively homogeneous convex function vanishing at the origin —
equivalently, a function whose epigraph is a convex cone containing the origin and no `(x, μ)` with
`μ < 0`. `isGauge_iff` is the other description: the gauges are exactly the `γ(· | C)` for nonempty
convex `C`. -/

/-! ### The polar of a gauge

`k°(y) = inf {μ ≥ 0 | ⟨x, y⟩ ≤ μ k(x) for all x}`. The content of this section is that `k°` is the
support function of `{k ≤ 1}`, hence a closed gauge, and that it is `γ(· | C°)` whenever
`k = γ(· | C)`. -/

The product `μ * k x` is `EReal` multiplication, so `0 * (+∞) = 0`; that makes `μ = 0` admissible
only when `⟨·, y⟩ ≤ 0` everywhere, which is the classical reading of the `μ* = 0` case. The infimum
is insensitive to the convention, since the admissible set is an up-set in `[0, ∞)`. -/

`E × ℝ` with `F × ℝ`. `prodPairing` (`Duality/Pairing.lean`) supplies it once `ℝ` is paired with
itself, and `mulPairing` is that self-pairing. -/

`f°(y) = inf {μ ≥ 0 | ⟨x, y⟩ ≤ 1 + μ f(x) for all x}`. The definition below is the `∞`-free reading
of that formula, quantifying over the epigraph of `f` rather than over `f` itself: `μ` is admissible
when `⟨x, y⟩ - ν μ ≤ 1` for every `(x, ν) ∈ epi f`. This says exactly that `(y, -μ)` lies in the
polar of `epi f`, which is what the classical proof uses, and `polarFn_apply_eq` shows it agrees

/-! ### Norms

A gauge that is finite everywhere, symmetric, and positive away from the origin is a **norm**. The
book states the correspondence with the *symmetric closed bounded convex sets `C` with
`0 ∈ int C`*. Two of those three conditions on `C` are the finite-dimensional readings of conditions
that make sense in general, and it is the general readings that are proved here:

* "`0 ∈ int C`", which in `Rⁿ` says that `C` contains a positive multiple of every vector, is
  `AbsorbsAll C`;
* "`C` is bounded", which in `Rⁿ` says that `C` contains no half-line, is `RayFree C`.

Closedness is *not* part of the correspondence here. The book gets it from the continuity of a
finite convex function on `Rⁿ`, which is genuinely finite-dimensional; in an infinite-dimensional
space a finite symmetric positive gauge need not be lower semicontinuous. -/

/-- **A Rockafellar norm is a `Seminorm`.** `Seminorm ℝ E` asks for subadditivity (which follows
from convexity and positive homogeneity), invariance under negation, and absolute homogeneity —
all three of which `IsNorm` carries, and none of which mentions a topology.

This is the bridge that lets a surface over `ℝⁿ` hand a Rockafellar norm to Mathlib's seminorm
API. What it does *not* give is a `NormedSpace`: for that the norm must be continuous, and
continuity of a finite convex function is a finite-dimensional fact. -/
