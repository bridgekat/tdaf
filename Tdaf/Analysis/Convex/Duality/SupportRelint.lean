# Relative interiors, interiors and affine hulls from the support function

The support function of a set records the closed half-spaces containing it, and therefore knows the
closed convex hull exactly: `x ∈ cl (conv s)` if and only if `⟨x, y⟩ ≤ δ*(y ∣ s)` for every `y`. In
finite dimensions it knows more — the relative interior, the interior and the affine hull of a
convex set can all be read off from *which* of those inequalities are strict.

The dividing line is the set of directions in which the support function is **additively
reversible**, `-δ*(-y ∣ C) = δ*(y ∣ C)`. These are exactly the directions in which `⟨·, y⟩` is
constant on `C`, i.e. along which `C` lies inside a hyperplane; no inequality can be strict there.
The relative interior asks for strictness everywhere else; the interior asks for strictness in
every direction but `0`, so there are no reversible directions to spare; and the affine hull asks
for equality in the reversible directions and nothing at all elsewhere.

## Main results

* `supportFn_neg_eq_neg_iff`, `neg_supportFn_neg_eq_iff` — the reversible directions of a support
  function are its directions of constancy.
* `mem_relint_iff_lt_supportFn`, `mem_interior_iff_lt_supportFn` — the `ri` and `int` clauses
  (Theorem 13.1 in [^1]).
* `mem_affineSpan_iff_eq_supportFn` — the `aff` clause: the affine hull of a set is the
  intersection of the hyperplanes containing it. No convexity is needed.
* `isBounded_iff_forall_bddAbove` — a set is bounded in the norm exactly when its support function
  is finite everywhere.

The closure clause is `mem_closure_convexHull_iff_le_supportFn`, in `Duality/Support.lean`; it is
the one clause of the four that holds in any locally convex space.

## Divergences from the reference

All three clauses here are genuinely finite-dimensional. Let `φ` be a discontinuous linear
functional and `C = ker φ`, a dense proper subspace: then `aff C = ri C = C` while `int C = ∅`, and
since a continuous functional constant on a dense set vanishes, the reversible directions of
`δ*(· ∣ C)` are exactly the `y` with `⟨·, y⟩ = 0` and `δ*(y ∣ C) = +∞` elsewhere. All three
conditions are then satisfied by every point of the space.

The `int` clause carries two hypotheses the book does not write. **`B.SeparatingRight`**: over `ℝⁿ`
paired with itself, `y ≠ 0` and `⟨·, y⟩ ≠ 0` are the same condition, but over a general pairing a
`y ≠ 0` pairing trivially with `E` would demand `⟨x, y⟩ = 0 < δ*(y ∣ C) = 0`. **`C.Nonempty`**: for
`C = ∅` the condition is false as soon as some `y ≠ 0` exists, and vacuously true over the zero
space, where `int ∅ = ∅`.
