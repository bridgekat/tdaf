# Simplices, locally simplicial sets, and upper semicontinuity

A convex function is upper semicontinuous relative to any *locally simplicial* subset of its
effective domain, so a closed convex function is continuous relative to such a set: Rockafellar's
**Theorem 10.2**. This is the sharp form of "a convex function is continuous on a simplex in its
domain"; the parabolic example of §10 shows that the phenomenon is genuinely about simplices and
not about arbitrary subsets of `dom f`. **Theorem 10.3** is the application: a finite convex
function on `ri C`, bounded above on bounded subsets, extends uniquely to a continuous finite
convex function on a locally simplicial convex `C`.

## Main definitions

* `IsSimplex S` — `S` is the convex hull of a finite affinely independent family.
* `LocallySimplicial S` — every point of `S` has a neighbourhood in which `S` coincides with a
  finite union of simplices contained in `S` (Rockafellar §10). Theorem 20.5 will say that every
  polyhedral convex set is locally simplicial.

## Main results

* `ConvexFn.upperSemicontinuousWithinAt_convexHull_range` — the analytic core: a convex function
  finite on the vertices of a simplex is upper semicontinuous relative to that simplex, at *every*
  one of its points.
* `ConvexFn.upperSemicontinuousOn_of_locallySimplicial` — **Theorem 10.2**.
* `ConvexFn.continuousOn_of_locallySimplicial` — Theorem 10.2 for a closed `f`.
* `exists_closedFn_continuousOn_of_locallySimplicial`, `eqOn_of_continuousOn_of_eqOn_relint` —
  **Theorem 10.3**, existence and uniqueness.

## Implementation notes

The analytic core needs no triangulation. Rockafellar reduces to the case where `x` is a *vertex*
of the simplex by triangulating around `x`. Instead, writing `x = Σ μᵢ vᵢ` and `z = Σ wᵢ vᵢ`, every
`z` whose weights satisfy `wᵢ ≥ (1 - ε) μᵢ` is `(1 - ε) x + ε y` with `y` again in the simplex, for
a *fixed* `ε` chosen in advance from the target bound; convexity then bounds `f z` by
`(1 - ε) β + ε ν`. That weight condition holds on a neighbourhood of `x` by compactness of the
standard simplex, affine independence making the weights of a point unique — the only use of
affine independence, and the only use of a topology: no metric, no finite dimension.
