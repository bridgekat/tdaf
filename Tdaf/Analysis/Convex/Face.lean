# Faces of a convex set

A **face** of a convex set `C` is a convex subset `C'` of `C` such that every closed line segment
in `C` with a relative interior point in `C'` has both endpoints in `C'`. Everything here rests on
one strengthening of that definition: a face absorbs every convex subset of `C` whose relative
interior it meets. From it come the partition of `C` by the relative interiors of its faces and,
for compact `C`, Minkowski's theorem.

This file treats the bounded case, which is what the polyhedral theory and the Krein–Milman
corollaries consume. The representation of an unbounded closed convex set needs hulls of points
*and* directions (`convexHullPD` in `HullDirections.lean`) and lives in `Representation.lean`; the
exposed representation is in `Exposed.lean` and `Tangent.lean`.

Extreme points and exposed faces are Mathlib's `Set.extremePoints` and `IsExposed`;
`isFace_singleton` and `IsExposed.isFace` connect them to `IsFace`.

## Main definitions

* `IsFace` — Rockafellar's face, as Mathlib's `IsExtreme ℝ C C'` plus convexity of `C'`.

## Main results
* `IsFace.subset_of_relint_inter_nonempty` — a face absorbs every convex subset of `C` whose
  relative interior it meets (Theorem 18.1 in [^1]).
* `IsFace.eq_inter_closure` — `C' = C ∩ cl C'`; a face of a closed convex set is closed.
* `IsFace.eq_of_relint_inter_nonempty` — faces whose relative interiors meet are equal.
* `IsFace.disjoint_relint`, `IsFace.subset_intrinsicFrontier`, `IsFace.finrank_vectorSpan_lt` — a
  proper face lies in the relative boundary and has strictly smaller dimension.
* `exists_isFace_subset_relint` — every nonempty relatively open convex subset of `C` lies in the
  relative interior of a unique face of `C`.
* `exists_isFace_mem_relint`, `eq_iUnion_relint_isFace`, `IsFace.relint_pairwise_disjoint`,
  `IsFace.relint_maximal` — the relative interiors of the nonempty faces partition `C`, and are
  exactly the maximal relatively open convex subsets of `C` (Theorem 18.2 in [^1]).
* `exists_notMem_relint_mem_segment` — in a compact set of positive dimension, every relative
  interior point lies on a segment joining two relative boundary points.
* `convexHull_extremePoints` — **Minkowski's theorem**: a compact convex set is the convex hull of
  its extreme points; `extremePoints_nonempty` records that it has one.

requirement, since `{0, 1}` is an extreme subset of `[0, 1]` but not a face of it. -/

/-- **Minkowski's theorem**: a closed bounded convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points.
It is the case of the general representation in which `C` has no directions of recession, and it is
stronger than Mathlib's Krein–Milman theorem (`closure_convexHull_extremePoints`), which gives only
the *closed* convex hull — the set of extreme points need not be closed even for a compact `C`. The
proof is an induction on `dim C`, through the partition of `C` by relative interiors of faces and
the segment lemma above. -/
