# Tangent half-spaces of a convex set

A hyperplane is **tangent** to a closed convex set `C` at a point `y` when it is the *unique*
supporting hyperplane to `C` at `y`, and a **tangent half-space** is a supporting half-space whose
boundary hyperplane is tangent. The theorem proved here is that a closed convex set with nonempty
interior is the intersection of its tangent closed half-spaces — a sharpening of the statement
that a closed convex set is the intersection of *all* the closed half-spaces containing it.

The interior hypothesis is not removable as stated: a closed convex set with empty interior lies in
a proper affine subspace and has no tangent hyperplane anywhere, since every supporting hyperplane
at a point can be tilted around that subspace. The right general statement intersects the tangent
half-spaces *within the affine hull* and adds the affine hull itself.

Tangency is dual to exposedness: after translating so that `0 ∈ int C`, the tangent half-spaces of
`C` correspond exactly to the exposed points of the polar `C°`, and this correspondence carries
the proof.

## Main definitions

* `IsSupportingAt C f y` — `y ∈ C` and the linear functional `f` attains its maximum over `C` at
  `y`, so `{z | f z ≤ f y}` is a supporting half-space and `{z | f z = f y}` a supporting
  hyperplane.
* `IsTangentAt C f y` — that supporting hyperplane is the only one at `y`: every nonzero
  functional supported at `y` is a *positive* multiple of `f`.

## Main results

* `eq_iInter_tangent_halfSpaces` — a closed convex set with nonempty interior is the intersection
  of the closed half-spaces tangent to it.
* `exists_isTangentAt_lt_of_zero_mem_interior` — the separating form: a point outside such a set
  is cut off by a tangent half-space.

## Implementation notes

The proof stays in the polar picture rather than homogenising. After translating so that
`0 ∈ int C`, the polar `C°` is compact; Minkowski's theorem writes it as the hull of its extreme
points, Straszewicz's theorem puts those in the closure of its exposed points, and the exposed
points of `C°` are exactly the normals of the tangent half-spaces to `C`. So a point outside `C` is
already excluded by the half-space of some *exposed* point of `C°`. Identifying an exposing
functional on `E*` with a point of `E`, which produces the point of contact, uses reflexivity
(`Module.evalEquiv`, packaged as `exists_forall_apply_eq`) — a step invisible in `ℝⁿ`.
