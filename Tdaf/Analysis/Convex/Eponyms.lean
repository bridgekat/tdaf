# Eponyms

Named theorems of convex analysis, under the names people search for. Every declaration here is an
`alias`: the library's primary names are descriptive (`biconj_eq_clFn`, `convexHull_extremePoints`),
which is right for a library organised by subject but is not what a reader looks up first. Where the
eponym is already the primary name — `fenchel_duality`, `farkas`, `helly_finite` — no alias appears.

`perspective` aliases a definition rather than a theorem: `smulRight f a` is Rockafellar's `fa`, the
perspective function under its other name.
