# When is a linear image closed?

A linear image `A C` of a convex set need not be closed. **Theorem 9.1** says that it is, and that
its recession cone is the image of the recession cone, as soon as

```
0⁺(cl C) ∩ ker A ⊆ lin (cl C).
```

Everything else in §9 — and Theorem 16.4's constraint qualification, and §27's existence theorems
— is a consequence.

## Main results

* `isClosed_image_of_recessionCone_inter_ker`, `recessionCone_image_of_recessionCone_inter_ker` —
  the two halves of **Theorem 9.1** under the *reduced* hypothesis `0⁺C ∩ ker A ⊆ {0}`;
  `Convex.closure_image_eq_and_recessionCone` and its three components are Theorem 9.1 as
  Rockafellar states it, and `image_recessionCone_subset` is the unconditional inclusion.
* `Convex.isClosed_add`, `Convex.closure_add_eq`, `Convex.recessionCone_add` — **Corollary 9.1.1**
  for two sets, with **Corollaries 9.1.2 and 9.1.3** following from it.
* `closedProperConvexFn_mapLin` — **Theorem 9.2**: a linear image of a closed proper convex
  function is closed proper convex, and the infimum defining it is attained.
* `closedProperConvexFn_infConv_of_recessionFn_symm`, `closedProperConvexFn_infConv` —
  **Corollaries 9.2.1 and 9.2.2**, for infimal convolution.
* `ClosedProperConvexFn.add`, `closedProperConvexFn_finsetSum`, `recessionFn_add`, `clFn_add` —
  **Theorem 9.3**: a sum of closed proper convex functions whose effective domains share a point is
  closed proper convex, its recession function is the sum, and `cl (f + g) = cl f + cl g`.
* `isClosed_epi_iSup`, `recessionFn_iSup`, `lscHull_iSup` — **Theorem 9.4**, pointwise suprema;
  `isClosed_epi_compLin`, `recessionFn_compLin`, `clFn_compLin` — **Theorem 9.5**, composition
  with a linear map.

## Implementation notes

Both halves of Theorem 9.1 come from one compactness argument: a decreasing sequence of nonempty
closed convex sets, each with recession cone `{0}`, hence compact (Theorem 8.4), hence with
nonempty intersection. The hypothesis says exactly that `N := 0⁺(cl C) ∩ ker A` is a subspace, and
splitting `cl C = N + (cl C ∩ M)` along a complement `M` of `N` leaves the image unchanged while
cutting the recession cone down to one that meets `ker A` only at `0`. Finite dimensionality of
the source is used only through Theorem 8.4; the target space needs none.

along any complement `M` of `N` produces a set with the same image, the same image of the recession
cone, and the *reduced* hypothesis `0⁺ ∩ ker A ⊆ {0}`. It is packaged as an existential so that

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 9.2.1** for two functions. If `f` and `g` are closed proper convex
and the set of directions of joint recession — those `z` with `(f0⁺) z + (g0⁺) (-z) ≤ 0` — is
symmetric, then `f □ g` is a closed proper convex function, the infimum defining it is attained,
and `(f □ g)0⁺ = f0⁺ □ g0⁺`.

This is strictly weaker in hypothesis than `closedProperConvexFn_infConv`, which asks the set of
directions of joint recession to be `{0}`. Symmetry allows a whole subspace of directions along
which `f` and `g` are affine with opposite slopes; `f = g = 0` is already such a pair, and the
conclusions hold for it.

Properness is where the symmetry does its work. A vertical line in `epi f + epi g` produces
directions with `(f0⁺) z + (g0⁺) (-z) ≤ -1`; symmetry then forces the reversed sum to be `≤ 0`
too, and `(f0⁺) (-z) + (g0⁺) z ≥ 1` by `le_recessionFn_of_neg_le`. -/
