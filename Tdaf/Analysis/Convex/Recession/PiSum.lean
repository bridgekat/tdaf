# Sums of finitely many convex sets

A sum `C₁ + ⋯ + Cₘ` of subsets of `E` is the image of the product set `∏ Cᵢ ⊆ ι → E` under the
sum map `(xᵢ) ↦ ∑ xᵢ`, so every question about the closure and the recession cone of a finite sum
becomes a question about a linear *image*, which the recession calculus of a linear map answers.
`Convex.isClosed_sum`, `Convex.closure_sum_eq` and `Convex.recessionCone_sum` are the `m`-ary
statements: closure and recession cone both distribute over a finite sum of convex sets.

The cancellation hypothesis is genuinely `m`-ary: a sum of `m` directions of recession can vanish
without any two of them cancelling, so it is stated on the family, and the two-set results of
`Recession/Closedness.lean` are kept separately rather than derived from these.
