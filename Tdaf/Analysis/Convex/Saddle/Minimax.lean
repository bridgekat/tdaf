# Minimax problems and conjugate saddle-functions

Rockafellar's §36 and the first part of §37. A function `K` of two variables has two iterated
extrema,

`maximin K = ⨆ u, ⨅ x, K (u, x)`  and  `minimax K = ⨅ x, ⨆ u, K (u, x)`,

the first is never above the second (Lemma 36.1), and when they agree their common value is the
**saddle-value** of `K`. A **saddle-point** is a point `p` at which `K (·, p.2)` is maximised and
`K (p.1, ·)` is minimised; Lemma 36.2 says that a saddle-point is exactly a pair of optimal
strategies together with the existence of the saddle-value.

§37 turns the two iterated extrema into a *conjugacy correspondence*: the lower and upper
conjugates `K̲*`, `K̄*` of a saddle-function are again saddle-functions, `-K̲* (0, 0)` and
`-K̄* (0, 0)` are the two iterated extrema of `K`, and Theorem 37.1 identifies both conjugates of
every member of an equivalence class `Ω (F)` in terms of the inverse of `F`.

## Main definitions

* `IsSaddlePoint K p` — `K (u, p.2) ≤ K p ≤ K (p.1, x)` for all `u`, `x`.
* `IsSaddlePointOn K C D p` — the same, with `u` ranging over `C` and `x` over `D`.
* `maximin K`, `minimax K` — Rockafellar's "sup inf" and "inf sup".
* `HasSaddleValue K` — `maximin K = minimax K`.
* `saddleLagrangian Bu F` — the Lagrangian of `(P)` read as a function on `V × X`, i.e. as a
  saddle-function.
* `flipBifun F` — the bifunction with its two arguments exchanged.
* `inverseBifun F` — Rockafellar's `F_*`, `(F_* x) u = -(Fu)(x)`.
* `lowerConjSaddle Bu Bx K`, `upperConjSaddle Bu Bx K` — the lower and upper conjugates `K̲*`,
  `K̄*` of a saddle-function.
* `bifunSaddleClass Bu Bx F` — the equivalence class `Ω (F)`, the saddle-functions between the two
  brackets of `F`.

## Main results

* `maximin_le_minimax` — **Lemma 36.1**, with no hypothesis of any kind, not even nonemptiness.
* `isSaddlePoint_iff_iSup_eq_iInf` — the one-equation form of the saddle-point condition. It is
  the workhorse: everything downstream is a computation of `⨆ u, K (u, x)` and `⨅ x, K (u, x)`.
* `isSaddlePoint_iff_attained` — **Lemma 36.2**.
* `maximin_eq_biSup_dom₁`, `minimax_eq_biInf_dom₂` — the outer extrema may always be restricted
  to the effective domains, with no hypothesis at all.
* `maximin_eq_biSup_biInf`, `minimax_eq_biInf_biSup`, `isSaddlePoint_iff_isSaddlePointOn_dom` —
  **Theorem 36.3**: for a closed proper concave-convex function the minimax problem on the whole
  space and the one on `C × D = dom K` have the same value and the same saddle-points.
* `IsSaddlePoint.mem_domSaddle`, `IsSaddlePoint.exists_maximin_eq_coe` — **Corollary 36.3.1**.
* `SaddleEquiv.maximin_eq`, `.minimax_eq`, `.hasSaddleValue_iff`, `.isSaddlePoint_iff` —
  **Theorem 36.4**.
* `isSaddlePoint_lagrangian_iff` — **Theorem 29.3**, which `Optimization/Lagrangian.lean` had to
  leave out for want of `IsSaddlePoint`.
* `mem_argmin_iff_exists_isSaddlePoint_lagrangian`,
  `isSaddlePoint_lagrangian_iff_mem_kuhnTucker` — **Theorem 36.6** (= **Corollary 29.3.1**), the
  general Kuhn–Tucker theorem.
* `isSaddlePoint_lagrangian_iff_normal_and_optimal`,
  `isSaddlePoint_lagrangian_iff_le_adjointBifun` — **Corollary 30.5.1**, which
  `Optimization/Normal.lean` had to leave out for the same reason.
* `upperClosedFn_saddleLagrangian`, `exists_unique_closedBifun_saddleLagrangian_eq` —
  **Theorem 36.5**: the Lagrangians of closed convex programs are exactly the upper closed
  concave-convex functions.
* `ConvexFn.biInf_eq_iInf_of_relint_dom_subset` — **Corollary 7.3.1** in the form Theorem 36.3
  runs on; a relocation candidate for `RelativeInterior.lean`, where
  `ConvexFn.exists_mem_relint_dom_lt` that it rests on already lives.
* `iSup_clConcave_eq_iSup`, `concaveConj_clConcave` — the concave mirrors of `iInf_clFn_eq_iInf`
  and of `conj_clFn` (**Theorem 12.2**, first half); relocation candidates for
  `Duality/ConcaveConj.lean`.
* `lowerConjSaddle_le_upperConjSaddle` — **§37**: `K̲* ≤ K̄*`, Lemma 36.1 again.
* `minimax_eq_neg_lowerConjSaddle_zero`, `maximin_eq_neg_upperConjSaddle_zero`,
  `hasSaddleValue_iff_conjSaddle_zero_eq` — **§37**, the displays before Corollary 37.1.3: the two
  iterated extrema of `K` are the two conjugates evaluated at the origin, so the saddle-value
  exists exactly when the conjugates agree there.
* `upperConjSaddle_eq_saddleLagrangian`, `lowerConjSaddle_eq_bracket_inverseBifun` —
  **Theorem 37.1**: `K̄* = ⟨u*, F_* x⟩` is the Lagrangian of `F` and `K̲* = ⟨F_*^* u*, x⟩` is the
  bracket of the inverse adjoint, for *every* `K` in `Ω (F)`.
* `concaveConvexFn_upperConjSaddle`, `upperClosedFn_upperConjSaddle`,
  `concaveConvexFn_lowerConjSaddle`, `lowerClosedFn_lowerConjSaddle` — **Corollary 37.1.1**: the
  lower conjugate is lower closed concave-convex and the upper conjugate is upper closed
  concave-convex, and both depend only on the class.
* `bifunOfSaddle_eq_of_mem_bifunSaddleClass`, `concaveConj_slice_eq_adjointBifun` — the two
  computations Theorem 37.1 rests on, each saying that one partial conjugate of `K` sees only one
  of the two partial closures and is therefore constant on `Ω (F)`.

## Design notes

**`HasSaddleValue` is the *existence* of the saddle-value, not its finiteness.** Rockafellar
(§36, first page) calls the common value of the two iterated extrema the saddle-value *when they
are equal*, and then states finiteness separately wherever he needs it (Corollary 36.3.1,
Corollary 37.1.3, Theorem 37.3). So `HasSaddleValue K` is the bare equation
`maximin K = minimax K`, and finiteness is a second conclusion. Building finiteness into the
definition would make Corollary 36.3.1 vacuous and would match none of the book's statements.

**`maximin` and `minimax` are taken over the whole space.** Rockafellar's §36 opens by showing
that a minimax problem on `C × D` is the same as one on `R^m × R^n` once `K` is extended by
`+∞`/`−∞`; the extended form is the one every later theorem uses, and it is the one taken here.
`IsSaddlePointOn` records the translation.

**Lemma 36.1 and Lemma 36.2 need no structure at all** — no topology, no module structure, and
not even nonemptiness of the two spaces (the book assumes `C × D ≠ ∅`, which the `±∞` extension
makes unnecessary). They are stated over bare types. So is Corollary 36.3.1, which needs only
`ProperSaddleFn`; and Theorem 36.4 needs only a topology on each factor — neither closedness nor
properness nor concave-convexity nor finite dimension enter.

**Theorem 36.5 goes through the *negated* pairing, not through the inverse bifunction.**
Rockafellar reads the Lagrangian as `L (v, x) = ⟨v, F_* x⟩`, a bracket of the *concave* inverse
`F_*`, and appeals to a concave mirror of Theorem 33.3 that the backbone does not have. The same
identity read after `saddleSwap` — which negates and exchanges the variables — is
`saddleSwap L = ⟨(flip F) x, v⟩` for the pairing `-Bu` (`saddleSwap_saddleLagrangian`), so the
*convex* Theorem 33.3 applies verbatim. The price is two instances,
`isCompatiblePairing_neg` and `flip_neg`, both three lines: negating a pairing preserves
continuity, and `g = ⟨·, y⟩` for `-B` exactly when `-g = ⟨·, y⟩` for `B`.

**`(F_*)^* = (F^*)_*` is taken as a definition, not proved.** Rockafellar writes the bifunction
behind the lower conjugate as `F_*^*`, the adjoint of the *concave* inverse, and then observes
that it agrees with `(F^*)_*`. The backbone has no concave adjoint of a concave bifunction, so
`inverseBifun (adjointBifun Bu Bx F)` is used throughout; the commutation is then a triviality
rather than a lemma, and `convexBifun_inverseBifun_adjointBifun` /
`closedBifun_inverseBifun_adjointBifun` supply the two facts Theorem 33.3 needs about it.

**Both conjugates are stated for an arbitrary member of `Ω (F)`, which is where their content
lies.** `upperConjSaddle` and `lowerConjSaddle` are defined for any `K` whatever; Theorem 37.1
says that on a class they do not see the representative, and that is exactly the statement that
makes minimax theory a theory of equivalence classes. The proofs are two sandwich arguments: the
partial conjugate in one variable sees only the partial closure in that variable
(`bifunOfSaddle_partialCl₂`, `concaveConj_clConcave`), and Theorem 33.2 says the two brackets are
each other's partial closures.

## What is not here

**The subgradient form of the Kuhn–Tucker condition** `(0, 0) ∈ ∂L (v̄, x̄)` is
`zero_mem_saddleSubgradient_saddleLagrangian_iff` in `Saddle/Subgradient.lean`, where §37's
`saddleSubgradient` lives. It is Theorem 37.4 applied to the tilt by the origin on top of
`isSaddlePoint_lagrangian_iff`, which is the "optimal solution plus Kuhn–Tucker vector" form
Rockafellar's Theorem 36.6 restates.

**The rest of §37 is in `Saddle/{Conjugate,Subgradient,Existence,Monotone}.lean`.** Corollary
37.1.2 (the two conjugates are a closure pair with the Theorem 34.3 structure), Corollary 37.1.3,
Theorem 37.2 and the existence theorems 37.3–37.6 are all there. Corollary 37.1.2 needed the
biadjoint identity `(F_*^*)^* = F_*` to put `K̲*` and `K̄*` into the *same* class the way
`partialCl₁_bracket` and `partialCl₂_concaveBracket_adjoint` do for `F`, and Theorem 37.2 needed
Theorem 6.8 (relative interiors of images). Corollary 37.6.2, the classical minimax theorem, is
proved from Rockafellar's own unbounded machinery rather than from Mathlib's
`Mathlib/Topology/Sion.lean`, because the unbounded theorems it specializes are wanted anyway.
