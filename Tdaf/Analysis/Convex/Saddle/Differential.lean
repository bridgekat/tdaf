# Directional derivatives and subgradients of a saddle-function

Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis*, §35, the differential half: **Theorems 35.6, 35.7 and 35.8** with
Corollaries 35.7.1 and 35.8.1. These are the §23/§24/§25 statements read for a concave-convex
function of a pair, on an open rectangle `C ×ˢ D` where the function is finite and real-valued.

## Main results

* `dirDerivReal` — the one-sided directional derivative `f'(x; y)` of a *real-valued* function,
  read as a genuine limit rather than as the infimum of the difference quotients.
* `dirDerivReal_prod` — **Theorem 35.6**, the displayed equation
  `K'(u, v; u', v') = K'(u, v; u', 0) + K'(u, v; 0, v')`; `tendsto_slope_dirDerivReal_prod` is the
  existence of the joint limit that it presupposes, `concaveConvexOn_dirDerivReal` and
  `dirDerivReal_prod_smul` the finiteness, concave-convexity and positive homogeneity clauses, and
  `dirDerivReal_prod_fst` / `dirDerivReal_prod_snd` the two readings on the axes.
* `subgradientFst`, `subgradientSnd`, `subgradientSaddle` — `∂₁K`, `∂₂K` and
  `∂K = ∂₁K ×ˢ ∂₂K`, with `subgradientSnd_eq_subgradient` and `subgradientFst_eq_neg_subgradient`
  identifying each block with a §23 subdifferential of a slice, so that §24 applies one variable at
  a time.
* `eventually_dirDerivReal_snd_lt`, `eventually_lt_dirDerivReal_fst` — **Theorem 35.7**, the two
  displayed semicontinuity inequalities, spelled without junk values.
* `eventually_subgradientSaddle_subset` — **Theorem 35.7**, third assertion:
  `∂K_i(u_i, v_i) ⊆ ∂K(u, v) + εB` eventually. Its two halves are
  `eventually_subgradientFst_subset` and `eventually_subgradientSnd_subset`.
* `lowerSemicontinuousAt_dirDerivReal_fst`, `upperSemicontinuousAt_dirDerivReal_snd`,
  `eventually_nhds_subgradientSaddle_subset` — **Corollary 35.7.1**, the constant sequence.
* `prodInnerL`, `HasSaddleGradientAt` — `∇K (u, v)` as a *pair* `(u*, v*)`, with
  `differentiableAt_iff_exists_hasSaddleGradientAt` saying that in finite dimensions this loses
  nothing.
* `subgradientSaddle_eq_singleton_of_hasSaddleGradientAt` and
  `hasSaddleGradientAt_of_subgradient_eq_singleton` — the two halves of **Theorem 35.8**, combined
  in `hasSaddleGradientAt_iff_subgradientSaddle_eq_singleton` and, in the book's shape, in
  `differentiableAt_iff_exists_subgradientSaddle_eq_singleton`.
* `differentiableAt_iff_isLinearMap_dirDerivReal` — **Corollary 35.8.1**: on a rectangle where `K`
  is already finite, differentiability is exactly linearity of `K'(u, v; ·, ·)`.

Four §23/§25 statements are proved here in real form because the `EReal` versions in
`Subgradient/` are not usable through a slice without a detour: `le_add_of_hasFDerivAt_of_convexOn`
and `eq_of_forall_add_le_of_hasFDerivAt` (**Theorem 25.1** and its uniqueness half),
`forall_inner_le_dirDerivReal_iff` (**Theorem 23.2** at an interior point) and
`subgradientSnd_nonempty` / `subgradientFst_nonempty` (**Theorem 23.4**). Each comes with its
concave mirror.

## Design notes

**The module is `Differential`, not `Subgradient`, because §37 owns that name.** What lives here
is the differential theory of a *real-valued* concave-convex function on an open rectangle —
`dirDerivReal`, `subgradientFst`, `subgradientSnd`, `subgradientSaddle`, `HasSaddleGradientAt` —
while `Saddle/Subgradient.lean` holds `concaveSubgradient` and `saddleSubgradient` for
`EReal`-valued saddle-functions, which is what §37's conjugacy needs. The two notions agree where
both apply, and unifying them is a deferred clean-up rather than a name clash.

**`dirDerivReal` is a limit, not an infimum.** `dirDeriv` (`Subgradient/Defs.lean`) is defined as
`⨅ t > 0, (f (x + t • y) - f x) / t`, which coincides with the limit exactly when the difference
quotient is monotone in the step. That is true along a line for a convex function and false for a
saddle-function in a *joint* direction — which is the whole content of Theorem 35.6 — so the limit
has to be taken literally here. `dirDerivReal` therefore takes the junk value `0` where the limit
does not exist, and every statement about it carries the hypotheses that make it exist.

**Theorem 35.6 is a `limsup` bound and its mirror, not a two-sided estimate.** The difference
quotient splits as `[K(u + tu', v) - K(u, v)]/t + [K(u + tu', v + tv') - K(u + tu', v)]/t`, whose
first summand converges by Theorem 23.1. `eventually_slope_snd_lt` bounds the second summand above
by anything above `K'(u, v; 0, v')`, using continuity of the concave slice along a line to move the
base point. The matching lower bound is that same lemma applied to `(x, w) ↦ -K (w, x)`, which is
again concave-convex (`ConcaveConvexOn.negSwap`); no second proof is needed.

**`∂K(u, v)` is a product, and that is the point.** The two variables never interact, which is what
makes Theorem 35.8 a statement about *separate* differentiability and what lets each block be
handled by a §23/§24 result about a single convex function. The price is
`subgradientSaddle_eq_singleton_iff`: `A ×ˢ B = {q}` implies `A = {q.1}` and `B = {q.2}` only when
both factors are nonempty, since an empty factor empties the product.

**`subgradientFst` and `subgradientSnd` test against `C` and `D`, not against the whole space.**
Rockafellar tests against all of `R^m`, which is the `C = univ` case. For a `K` given, and
concave-convex, only on a rectangle, testing against the rectangle is the right reading, and the
two agree whenever `K` is extended off `C × D` by the simple extension of `Saddle/Kernel.lean`,
which is `-∞`/`+∞` there and makes the extra inequalities vacuous.

**Theorem 35.8's converse is proved from Corollary 35.7.1, not from Theorem 35.4.** Rockafellar
upgrades separate differentiability to joint differentiability by applying Theorem 35.4 to the
rescalings `h_λ(x, y) = [K(u + λx, v + λy) - K(u, v) - λ⟪x, u*⟫ - λ⟪y, v*⟫]/λ`. Corollary 35.7.1 is
downstream of Theorem 35.4 anyway, and it gives the Fréchet estimate directly: sandwich the
increment between subgradient inequalities at `(u, v)`, `(u, v + b)` and `(u + a, v + b)`, each of
whose subgradients lies within `ε` of `q`. That also makes the converse half of Theorem 25.1 —
which `Subgradient/Gradient.lean` records as missing — a special case of the same argument.

**`U × X` is not an inner-product space.** Mathlib gives a product of normed spaces the *supremum*
norm, so `∇K (u, v)` cannot be a vector of `U × X` in the sense of `innerSL`, and Mathlib's
`gradient` does not apply. `prodInnerL q` is the continuous functional
`(w, x) ↦ ⟪w, q.1⟫ + ⟪x, q.2⟫` that a pair represents, and `HasSaddleGradientAt K q p` is
`HasFDerivAt K (prodInnerL q) p`. The same choice of norm is why Theorem 35.7's `εB` is the
supremum ball rather than Rockafellar's Euclidean one; the two differ by a factor bounded by `√2`,
and every statement here quantifies over all `ε > 0`.

## What is not here

**Theorems 35.9 and 35.10 are in `Saddle/Rademacher.lean`**, which imports this file. Their
measure-zero and density clauses need Rademacher's theorem, and keeping the measure-theoretic
imports out of here costs nothing: 35.9's continuity clause is
`eventually_nhds_subgradientSaddle_subset` below with the subdifferentials collapsed by
Theorem 35.8, and 35.10 is `eventually_subgradientSaddle_subset` the same way.

**Corollary 35.8.1's last clause is not formalised**: that finiteness of the `m + n` two-sided
partial derivatives already forces differentiability. It is a statement about a coordinate basis,
not about the underlying spaces, and it adds nothing that
`differentiableAt_iff_isLinearMap_dirDerivReal` does not already give.

**Everything is stated on an *open* rectangle.** Rockafellar restricts to interior points of
`dom K` "for the sake of simplicity" and so does this file; the relatively open case would need
`ri` versions of Theorems 23.1 and 23.2, which is a §23 project rather than a §35 one.

/-! ### The one-sided directional derivative of a real-valued function -/

/-- The **one-sided directional derivative** `f'(x; y)` of a real-valued function: the limit of the
difference quotient as the step decreases to `0`.

This is `dirDeriv` (`Subgradient/Defs.lean`) read in `ℝ` rather than in `EReal`. The `EReal`
version is an infimum, which is the limit only when the quotient is monotone in the step -- true
for a convex function, false for a saddle-function in a joint direction, which is precisely what
Rockafellar's Theorem 35.6 is about. So the limit has to be taken literally here, and the value is
junk (`0`) when it does not exist. -/

The quotient is the secant slope of `f` along the line `t ↦ x + t • y` based at `t = 0`; it is
nondecreasing (`ConvexOn.secant_mono`) and bounded below by its value at a negative step, so it
converges to its infimum. -/

convex slice below `μ`; the concave slice is continuous along the line `t ↦ u + t • u'`, so the
same secant slope at the moving point `u + t • u'` is still below `μ` for small `t`; and the secant
slope at step `t ≤ α` is below the one at step `α`, by convexity in the second variable. -/

Spelled without junk values: every real `μ` above `K'(u, v; 0, v')` eventually bounds
`K_i'(u_i, v_i; 0, v')`. A single step `α > 0` realises a secant slope of `K (u, ·)` below `μ`;
continuous convergence carries that slope to `K i` at the moving points; and the directional
derivative is below every secant slope. -/

an inner-product space and neither Mathlib's `gradient` nor `innerSL` applies to a function of a

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 35.8**, converse half: a finite concave-convex function with a *unique*
subgradient at a point of an open rectangle where it is finite is differentiable there, jointly in
the two variables.

The proof is not Rockafellar's. He upgrades separate differentiability to joint differentiability
through Theorem 35.4, applied to the rescalings
`h_λ (x, y) = [K (u + λx, v + λy) - K (u, v) - λ⟪x, u*⟫ - λ⟪y, v*⟫] / λ`, which converge pointwise
to `0` and therefore, being concave-convex, uniformly on bounded sets. Corollary 35.7.1 is already
that theorem's consequence, and it gives the estimate outright: the increment
`K (u + a, v + b) - K (u, v)` is sandwiched by subgradient inequalities at the three points
`(u, v)`, `(u, v + b)` and `(u + a, v + b)`, each of whose subgradients lies within `ε` of `q`, so
the error is at most `ε (‖a‖ + ‖b‖)`. -/

Rockafellar states it as "`cl f'(x; ·)` is the support function of `∂f(x)`"; at an interior point
of an open set no closure is needed, and this is the pointwise reading. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 35.8.1**: `∇K(u, v) = q` exactly when `K'(u, v; ·, ·)` is the linear
function `prodInnerL q`.

The forward direction is `dirDerivReal_eq_of_hasFDerivAt` and needs no hypothesis at all. The
converse restricts the assumed identity to the two axes — which Theorem 35.6 identifies with the
two partial directional derivatives — turns each into a one-point subdifferential by Theorem 25.2,
and then invokes Theorem 35.8. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 35.8.1**, in the book's phrasing: for a concave-convex function
already finite on an open rectangle — Rockafellar's "`K` is finite on a neighbourhood of `(u, v)`"
— differentiability at `(u, v)` is exactly linearity of `K'(u, v; ·, ·)`.

The corollary's last clause, that finiteness of the `m + n` two-sided partial derivatives already
suffices, is not formalised: it is a statement about a coordinate basis rather than about the
space. -/
