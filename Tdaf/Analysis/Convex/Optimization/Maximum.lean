# The maximum of a convex function

Maximising a convex function behaves nothing like minimising one. The **maximum principle** says
that a maximiser in the relative interior of `C` forces `f` to be constant on `C`, so maxima live
on the boundary: on faces, and ultimately on extreme points. Taking a convex hull raises neither
the supremum nor the maximiser set, so the supremum over a closed convex set is already carried by
its relative boundary and — when `C` contains no lines and `f` is bounded above on each half-line
of `C` — by the extreme points of `C`. That boundedness is what makes the extreme *directions*
invisible: `f x = x` on `C = [0, ∞)` has supremum `⊤` over `C` and `0` over the one extreme point,
and `ConvexFn.iSup_extremePoints_add_coneHull` is the unconditional statement keeping them.

## Main definitions

* `BddAboveOnRays f C` — `f` is bounded above on every half-line of `C`. The direction `0` makes
  this include `C ⊆ dom f`, so it carries both standing hypotheses of the extreme point principle.

## Main results

* `ConvexFn.eq_of_isMaxOn_mem_relint` — the maximum principle (Theorem 32.1 in [^1]), with
  `exists_isFace_forall_eq_of_isMaxOn` for the face it forces; `ConvexFn.iSup_convexHull`,
  `exists_eq_of_isMaxOn_convexHull` — the convex hull raises neither the supremum nor the
  maximiser set; `ConvexFn.iSup_sdiff_relint`, `exists_notMem_relint_eq_of_isMaxOn` — the relative
  boundary carries both.
* `ConvexFn.iSup_extremePoints_of_containsNoLine`,
  `ConvexFn.iSup_extremePoints_inter_of_isCompl`, `ConvexFn.iSup_extremePoints_add_coneHull` —
  the extreme point principle (Theorem 32.3 in [^1]): for a line-free `C`, for a general `C` cut
  down by a complement of its lineality space, and in representation form.
* `exists_isMaxOn_of_polyhedral_of_bddAboveOnRays`,
  `exists_mem_extremePoints_isMaxOn_of_finitelyGenerated` — attainment over a polyhedral and over
  a finitely generated set; `ConvexFn.iSup_extremePoints`,
  `exists_mem_extremePoints_isMaxOn_of_isCompact` — the compact case.
* `mem_normalCone_of_mem_subgradient_of_isMaxOn` — at a maximiser, every subgradient is normal.

## Implementation notes

Maximisation is spelled `∀ z ∈ C, f z ≤ f x` rather than `IsMaxOn`, the form every proof consumes;
`isMaxOn_iff` bridges. The lineality space `L` of `C` is quotiented out by intersecting with a
complement `N` rather than by passing to `E ⧸ L`: `C = L + (C ∩ N)` holds for *any* `N`, so no
inner product is needed where the book takes `N = L⊥`.
