# Relative interiors of convex sets

The theory of relative interiors of convex sets in a finite-dimensional real normed space. The
*relative interior* `ri C` is the interior of `C` taken relative to its affine hull; it is Mathlib's
`intrinsicInterior ℝ C`, so no new definition is introduced, and what this file adds is the
convexity theory that `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Intrinsic` does not carry. Finite dimension also
sharpens several statements about convex functions and about separation that the topological
modules `Closure.lean` and `Separation.lean` can state only in dimension-free form.

## Main definitions

* `ri` — scoped notation for `intrinsicInterior ℝ`, matching Rockafellar's usage.

## Main results

* `mem_intrinsicInterior_iff` — the metric description of `ri s`: a point of the affine hull lies
  in `ri s` exactly when some ball of the affine hull around it is contained in `s`. This is the
  cornerstone from which the rest of the file is derived.
* `Convex.subset_closure_inter_setOf_pos`, `Convex.closure_inter_setOf_pos` — a convex set on which
  a linear functional is non-negative and somewhere positive is the closure of the part where the
  functional is positive; a segment argument with no relative interiors in it, here because it is
  the density step of the cross-section arguments.
* `Convex.segment_mem_relint` — the *line segment principle*: the half-open segment from a
  relative interior point towards a point of the closure stays in `ri C` (Theorem 6.1 in [^1]).
* `Convex.relint_nonempty`, `Convex.affineSpan_relint` — a nonempty convex set has a nonempty
  relative interior, and the same affine hull as it.
* `Convex.interior_subset_relint` — the full-dimensional collapse `ri C = int C`, in the direction
  every caller uses.
* `Convex.closure_relint`, `Convex.relint_closure` — `C`, `ri C` and `cl C` share a closure and a
  relative interior, whence `Convex.closure_eq_iff_relint_eq` and
  `Convex.relint_inter_nonempty_of_isOpen`.
* `Convex.mem_relint_iff_prolong` — the *prolongation principle*: `z ∈ ri C` exactly when every
  segment of `C` ending at `z` continues past it (Theorem 6.4 in [^1]).
* `Convex.closure_iInter`, `Convex.relint_iInter` — closure and relative interior commute with an
  intersection whose relative interiors meet, with `Convex.relint_inter_affine` and
  `Convex.relint_subset_relint_of_subset_closure`.
* `Convex.relint_image` — linear images commute with `ri`, with `Convex.relint_smul` and
  `Convex.relint_add`; `Convex.relint_preimage` and `Convex.closure_preimage` do the same for
  inverse images, provided some point is carried into `ri D`.
* `Convex.mem_relint_prod_iff` — relative interior points of a convex set in a product, read off
  from the projection and the slice; `Convex.relint_cone_prodMk_one` applies it to the cone over
  `C`, and `Convex.relint_convexHull_union` to the convex hull of a union.
* `ConvexFn.relint_epi` — the relative interior of an epigraph, whence
  `ConvexFn.exists_mem_relint_dom_lt` and `ConvexFn.le_of_mem_closure`.
* `ConvexFn.eq_bot_of_mem_relint_dom` — an improper convex function is `−∞` on `ri (dom f)`.
* `ConvexFn.proper_clFn`, `ConvexFn.clFn_eq_of_mem_relint_dom` — the closure of a proper convex
  function is proper and agrees with it on `ri (dom f)`; with `ConvexFn.relint_dom_clFn` and
  `ConvexFn.interior_dom_clFn`, `dom (cl f)` has the same relative interior *and* the same
  interior as `dom f`.
* `ConvexFn.tendsto_lscHull_along_segment_relint` — the closure of `f` at `y` as a limit of `f`
  along a segment towards `y` from a relative interior point of `dom f`.
* `ConvexFn.relint_setOf_le`, `ConvexFn.closure_setOf_le` — the relative interior and the closure
  of a level set, with `ConvexFn.relint_setOf_lt_eq`, `ConvexFn.closure_setOf_lt_eq` and the
  relatively open and closed special cases.
* `exists_separatesProperly_iff_disjoint_relint` — two nonempty convex sets separate properly
  exactly when their relative interiors are disjoint (Theorem 11.3 in [^1]).

## Implementation notes

Everything rests on `mem_intrinsicInterior_iff`, which converts `x ∈ ri s` — defined in Mathlib
through the subspace topology on `affineSpan ℝ s` — into a statement about distances in the ambient
space. Rockafellar instead reduces to the full-dimensional case by transporting along an affine
isomorphism; the metric description avoids that transport, and the `AddTorsor` bookkeeping a change
of ambient space would force on every proof. Finite-dimensionality enters through
`intrinsicClosure_eq_closure` and through closedness of affine subspaces; results not needing it
carry `omit [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`.

The convexity lemmas are named `Convex.*` and shadow the root namespace `Convex`. Generalised field
notation resolves `hC.segment_mem_relint` against the *root* `Convex` namespace only, so these
lemmas must be applied by their explicit names, `Convex.segment_mem_relint hC …`.

/-! ### The positive part of a convex set

A convex set on which a continuous linear functional is non-negative and somewhere positive is the
closure of the part where the functional is *strictly* positive. This is a segment argument in a
topological vector space — no relative interiors, no finite dimension — and it is the density step
that every "a closed convex cone is the closure of the cone generated by one of its cross-sections"
argument runs on. -/

`ℓ` is non-negative on a convex set `C` and positive at one of its points `x₀`, then every point `x`

`(1 - t) x + t x₀` have `ℓ` value `(1 - t) ℓ x + t ℓ x₀ > 0` for `0 < t ≤ 1`. No continuity of `ℓ`
is needed, the approximating points being produced explicitly. -/

section Separation

/-! ### Transversal thickening

Rockafellar's device for turning a relative-interior statement into an interior statement: add to
`C` a complement `W'` of the direction of its affine hull. The thickened set `C + W'` is convex, its
affine hull is everything (so it has nonempty interior), and it meets `aff C` in `C` again — so
`x ∉ ri C` becomes `x ∉ int (C + W')` and Mathlib's separation theorems for *open* convex sets
apply. The three lemmas below need the topology but not `[FiniteDimensional ℝ E]`, which is why
each carries an `omit`; finite-dimensionality enters only in `exists_lt_of_notMem_relint`, through
`Convex.interior_nonempty_iff_affineSpan_eq_top` and closedness of an affine subspace. -/
