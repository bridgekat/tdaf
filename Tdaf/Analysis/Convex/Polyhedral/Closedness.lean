# Closedness of a sum with a polyhedral set

Corollary 9.1.1 keeps `C₁ + C₂` closed only when every cancelling pair of recession directions
lies in *both* lineality spaces. If `C₁` is polyhedral, the requirement on the `C₁` side
disappears: that is **Theorem 20.3**, and **Corollary 20.3.1** is its strong-separation form.

## Main results

* `isClosed_add_of_polyhedral`, `separatesStrongly_of_polyhedral_of_recession` — **Theorem 20.3**
  and **Corollary 20.3.1**.
* `nonempty_dom_supportFn_inter_relint` — the constraint qualification Theorem 20.3 turns on, read
  off from Theorem 20.2 applied to the two barrier cones.

## Implementation notes

Closedness is read off effective domains rather than from an infimal convolution formula: once
`IsExactSum.of_polyhedral` gives `(δ*(· | C₁) + δ*(· | C₂))* = δ(· | C₁) □ δ(· | C₂)`, the left
side is `δ(· | cl (C₁ + C₂))` and the domain of the right side is `C₁ + C₂`.

/-- **The constraint qualification of Theorem 20.3.** Under the recession hypothesis the barrier
cone of `C₁` meets the *relative interior* of the barrier cone of `C₂`. This is where polyhedrality
of `C₁` is spent: otherwise Theorem 20.2 separates the two barrier cones by a hyperplane, which
Corollary 14.2.1 reads as a recession direction violating the hypothesis. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 20.3.** Let `C₁` be a nonempty polyhedral convex set and `C₂` a nonempty
closed convex set. If every direction of recession of `C₁` whose opposite recedes `C₂` is itself a
direction of recession of `C₂` — that is, a direction in which `C₂` is linear — then `C₁ + C₂` is
closed. Corollary 9.1.1 asks in addition that such a direction lie in the lineality space of `C₁`;
polyhedrality of `C₁` removes that requirement. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 20.3.1.** Two disjoint sets, one polyhedral and the other closed, can
be separated *strongly* as soon as their only common direction of recession is one in which the
closed one is linear. Compare Corollary 11.4.2, which asks for no common direction of recession at
all, and Corollary 19.3.3, where both sets are polyhedral and no recession hypothesis is needed. -/
