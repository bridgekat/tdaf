# Finite generation and a finite set of faces

A closed convex set has only finitely many faces exactly when it is finitely generated. This is
the third description of a polyhedral convex set: `Polyhedral/Defs.lean` identifies "polyhedral"
with "finitely generated", and this module adds "closed, with a finite set of faces".

## Main results

* `FinitelyGenerated.finite_setOf_isFace`, `FinitelyGenerated.of_isFace` — a finitely generated
  set has finitely many faces, each of them finitely generated. Both come from the description of
  a face as the hull of the generating points it contains and the generating directions in which
  it recedes, so the faces are indexed by pairs of subsets of the generators.
* `finitelyGenerated_of_finite_setOf_isFace`, `polyhedral_of_finite_setOf_isFace` — the converse
  for a closed convex set, by way of the lineality-zero case
  `finitelyGenerated_of_finite_setOf_isFace_of_containsNoLine`.
* `polyhedral_iff_isClosed_finite_setOf_isFace` — the characterisation the two halves give.

## Implementation notes

Extreme directions are counted as rays, not as vectors: `extremeDirections C` is closed under
positive rescaling and so is never finite. What a finite face set bounds is the number of
half-line faces, and `exists_finite_generating_extremeDirections` turns that bound into a finite
generating set by choosing a direction vector for each half-line face.

`C ∩ M` correspond to those of `C`, and `C ∩ M` contains no lines because a line inside it would
have its direction in `N ⊓ M = ⊥`. So `C ∩ M` is finitely generated and `C` is a sum of two
polyhedral sets. -/
