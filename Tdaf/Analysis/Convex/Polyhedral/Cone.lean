# Polyhedral convex cones and the Minkowski–Weyl theorem

The cone half of Rockafellar's §19, and the gate for all of §19–§22.

A convex cone can be described in two ways: *from outside*, as the solution set of finitely many
homogeneous linear inequalities (`PolyhedralCone`, an H-cone), or *from inside*, as the set of
nonnegative combinations of finitely many vectors (`FinitelyGeneratedCone`, a V-cone). In finite
dimensions the two descriptions are equivalent. That is the Minkowski–Weyl theorem, and it is not
in Mathlib — Mathlib has the two predicates for pointed cones (`PointedCone.DualFG` and
`PointedCone.FG`) and says in a docstring that they agree by Minkowski–Weyl, without a proof.

## Main results

* `FinitelyGeneratedCone.polyhedralCone` — Weyl's half, V ⇒ H, proved by Fourier–Motzkin
  elimination. Purely algebraic: no topology, only `FiniteDimensional`.
* `PolyhedralCone.isClosed` and `FinitelyGeneratedCone.isClosed` — a corollary of Weyl's half,
  and the reason Weyl is proved first.
* `PolyhedralCone.finitelyGeneratedCone` — Minkowski's half, H ⇒ V, by separation in the dual.
* `polyhedralCone_iff_finitelyGeneratedCone` — **Theorem 19.1** for cones.

## Design notes

**Which half is proved by hand.** Fourier–Motzkin is done once, for Weyl's half, in the form
"adding a ray to a polyhedral cone leaves it polyhedral" (`PolyhedralCone.add_ray`). Rockafellar's
own route runs the elimination in the other direction and then needs closedness of a finitely
generated cone as a separate input, proved from Carathéodory. Proving Weyl first makes closedness
free — a finitely generated cone is an intersection of finitely many closed half-spaces — and
Carathéodory is not needed at all.

**Minkowski by duality, without the polar calculus.** `Duality/Polar.lean` would give H ⇒ V
through `polarCone_polarCone_of_isClosed`, at the cost of choosing a pairing of `E` with a space
that represents its continuous dual. The argument below instead pairs `E` with `Module.Dual ℝ E`
directly and uses only `geometric_hahn_banach_closed_point`, which is shorter and keeps the
statement free of a pairing parameter. The polar-calculus form of the theorem is a corollary and
belongs with §19's set-level results.

**`add_ray` is stated with a difference, not a sum.** `{x | ∃ t ≥ 0, x - t • v ∈ K}` and
`K + {t • v | t ≥ 0}` are the same set, but the difference form is what the elimination proof
manipulates and what `coe_hull_insert` produces, so it is the one that is stated.

/-- **Minkowski's half of Minkowski–Weyl**: a polyhedral convex cone is finitely generated.

The generators are produced in the dual: the cone `C` generated by the constraint functionals is
finitely generated, hence polyhedral by Weyl's half, and the functionals cutting `C` out are
evaluations at points `v₁, …, v_m` of `E` because a finite-dimensional space is reflexive. Those
points generate `K`. One inclusion is immediate; the other separates a point of `K` from the cone
they generate — which is closed, again by Weyl's half — and observes that the separating
functional lies in `C`. -/
