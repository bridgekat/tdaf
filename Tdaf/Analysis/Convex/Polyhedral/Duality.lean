# Polyhedral constraint qualifications

Rockafellar's §20: the constraint qualifications of §16 weaken when one of the two functions is
polyhedral. `Duality/Relint.lean` asks for a *common relative interior point* of the two effective
domains; here the polyhedral side contributes only a point of its effective domain.

## Main results

* `IsExactSum.of_polyhedral_pair` — the case where *both* functions are polyhedral: no relative
  interiors are involved at all, only `dom f ∩ dom g ≠ ∅`.
* `IsExactSum.of_polyhedral` — **Theorem 20.1**: a polyhedral `f` and a *proper convex* `g` add
  exactly as soon as `dom f` meets `ri (dom g)`. `IsExactSum.of_polyhedral_closed` is the closed
  case, which carries the argument.
* `relint_inter_relint_nonempty_of_subset_affineSpan` — the relative-interior step the proof of
  Theorem 20.1 turns on.
* `IsExactFinsetSum.of_polyhedral` — **Theorem 20.1** for `m` summands, with
  `IsExactFinsetSum.of_polyhedral_pair` the all-polyhedral case and `polyhedralFn_finsetSum`
  (**Theorem 19.4**) the step that makes the polyhedral block a single polyhedral summand.
* `IsExactImage.of_polyhedral` — the same weakening on the *image* side: a proper polyhedral `g`
  pulls back exactly as soon as the range of `A` meets `dom g`. This is what gives Theorems 16.3
  and 23.9 their polyhedral clauses.
* `epi_mapLin_of_polyhedralFn`, `polyhedralFn_mapLin`, `exists_mapLin_eq_of_polyhedralFn`,
  `polyhedralFn_compLin` — **Corollary 19.3.1** in full: the image `Af` is polyhedral, the infimum
  defining it is attained, and the composite `gA` is polyhedral. The attainment clause is what the
  image constructor runs on.

## Design notes

**The pair case is `of_relint`'s proof with Corollary 9.1.1 replaced by polyhedrality.** Both
proofs need the same one fact, that `epi f* + epi g*` is closed; `of_relint` gets it from the
recession-cone criterion, and here it is free, because a sum of polyhedral sets is polyhedral
(**Corollary 19.3.2**) and a polyhedral set is closed. Everything downstream —
`epi_infConv_of_polyhedralFn` (**Corollary 19.3.4**), properness of `f* □ g*`, and the splitting
that `IsExactSum.exact_le` asks for — is then identical.

**`ClosedFn` is not a hypothesis on either side.** A polyhedral convex function that is proper is
automatically closed (`PolyhedralFn.closedFn`), so where `of_relint_closed` takes
`ClosedProperConvexFn` this file takes `PolyhedralFn` plus `Proper`. On the *non*-polyhedral side
the closed case `of_polyhedral_closed` still asks for it — Theorem 12.2 is what makes `g*` proper —
but `of_polyhedral` removes it by Theorem 9.3, exactly as `of_relint` does. The asymmetry of
Theorem 20.1 survives the removal because the closure formula is used in its conjugate form
`conj_add_eq_conj_clFn_add_clFn`, whose two segment hypotheses are met on different grounds:
Corollary 7.5.1 for the closed polyhedral `f`, Theorem 7.5 for `g`.

**The image rule owes nothing to §20.** `IsExactImage.of_polyhedral` looks like the image-side
twin of `IsExactSum.of_polyhedral`, but its proof shares not a line: polyhedrality of `A' g*` is
Corollary 19.3.1 and makes the closure in Theorem 16.3 vacuous outright, so neither the affine-hull
indicator nor `relint_inter_relint_nonempty_of_subset_affineSpan` appears. It is filed here because
this is the module that owns the polyhedral constraint qualifications, not because it reuses them.

**Corollary 19.3.1 lives here, with both halves, and `epi_mapLin_of_polyhedralFn` is the identity
they both come from.** `epi (Af)` is in general only the epigraph *closure* of the image of
`epi f`; for polyhedral `f` the image is already an epigraph, and polyhedrality of `Af`
(`polyhedralFn_mapLin`) and attainment of the infimum (`exists_mapLin_eq_of_polyhedralFn`) are two
readings of that one sentence. `polyhedralFn_mapLin` used to sit in `Optimization/Perturbation.lean`
(§29), where it duplicated the identity and was invisible from here; it was moved down, which cost
`Optimization/Perturbation.lean` and `Saddle/Correspondence.lean` an import of this module and
three modules of import closure each. Its comap partner `polyhedralFn_compLin` came down with it,
from `Saddle/Correspondence.lean` (§37) — §31 could not import a §37 module and restated it, and
§19 could not either and reproved it, so the two-line proof existed three times.

**The general case is Rockafellar's own reduction, and it runs on an indicator.** With
`M = aff (dom g)` and `δ = δ(· | M)`, the function `δ + f` is again polyhedral — `M` is polyhedral
by `polyhedral_coe_affineSubspace` — and its effective domain `M ∩ dom f` *does* have a relative
interior point in common with `dom g`, so `of_relint` applies to `δ + f` and `g`. Since `δ` is
absorbed by anything whose effective domain lies in `M`, both `δ + g = g` and `δ + (f + g) = f + g`;
splitting `(δ + f)*` with the pair case and re-absorbing the leftover `δ*` into `g*` with the first
identity turns the exact splitting for `δ + f` into one for `f`.

/-- **The relative-interior step in Rockafellar's proof of Theorem 20.1.** If a convex set `D₁`
lies in the affine hull of a convex set `D₂` and the two share a point of `ri D₂`, then `ri D₁`
and `ri D₂` already share a point.

The shared point `x₀` need not itself be in `ri D₁`. But `ri D₂` is a relatively open
neighbourhood of `x₀` inside `aff D₂`, which contains `aff D₁`, so a small push from `x₀` towards
any point of `ri D₁` — nonempty by Theorem 6.2 — lands in both. Both pushes are the line segment
principle (Theorem 6.1); the prolongation principle (Theorem 6.4), applied to the reflection of
that point in `x₀`, is what produces a point of `D₂` beyond `x₀` for the second one to start
from. -/

function add exactly as soon as `dom f` meets `ri (dom g)`: the polyhedral side contributes only a
point of its effective domain, not of its relative interior.

The proof is Rockafellar's. Let `M = aff (dom g)` and `δ = δ(· | M)`, and put `h = δ + f`. Then
`ri (dom h)` does meet `ri (dom g)`, so `of_relint` splits `(h + g)* = (f + g)*` exactly; the pair
case splits `h*` as `δ* □ f*`; and `δ* □ g* = (δ + g)* = g*` re-absorbs the `δ*` that the first

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 20.1** in the book's own `m`-ary form: let `f₁, …, fₘ` be proper convex
with `f₁, …, f_k` polyhedral, and suppose

`dom f₁ ∩ ⋯ ∩ dom f_k ∩ ri (dom f_{k+1}) ∩ ⋯ ∩ ri (dom fₘ) ≠ ∅`.

Then `f₁, …, fₘ` add exactly.

`t` is the book's `{1, …, k}` and `u` its complement `{k+1, …, m}`; the splitting is spelled
membership-wise rather than as `s = t ∪ u` so that no `DecidableEq` instance enters the statement.
The proof is Rockafellar's own: `∑_{i ∈ t} fᵢ` is polyhedral (**Theorem 19.4**,
`polyhedralFn_finsetSum`) and adds exactly to `∑_{i ∈ u} fᵢ` by the *binary* Theorem 20.1, while
each of the two blocks adds exactly on its own — the polyhedral one by the all-polyhedral case, the
other by Theorem 16.4. `IsExactFinsetSum.of_split` is what glues the three together. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 19.3.1**, as an identity of epigraphs: for a polyhedral `f` the
epigraph of the image `Af` really *is* the image of `epi f` under `(x, μ) ↦ (Ax, μ)`.

In general `epi (Af)` is only the *epigraph closure* of that image, because an infimum need not be
attained. Here the image is polyhedral (**Theorem 19.3**), hence closed, and a closed set with
upward-closed vertical sections is already an epigraph — which is what `epi_mapLin` asks for.

Both halves of Corollary 19.3.1 fall out of this one identity: polyhedrality of `Af`, and the
attainment `exists_mapLin_eq_of_polyhedralFn` below. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 19.3.1**, the polyhedrality clause: the image of a polyhedral convex
function under a linear transformation is polyhedral.

Read off `epi_mapLin_of_polyhedralFn`: `epi (Af)` *is* the image of `epi f`, and the image of a
polyhedral set under a linear map is polyhedral (**Theorem 19.3**). -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 19.3.1**, the other half: a polyhedral convex function composed with
a linear map is polyhedral. `epi (gA)` is `epi g` pulled back along `(x, μ) ↦ (A x, μ)`, and a
preimage of a polyhedral set under a linear map is polyhedral (`Polyhedral.comap`).

This is much the cheaper direction: pulling back needs neither closedness nor attainment, so no
finite dimension is used on either side — which is why it carries an `omit` where its image-side
partner `polyhedralFn_mapLin` cannot. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 19.3.1**, the attainment clause: wherever `(Af)(y)` is finite the
infimum defining it is attained, so some `x` in the fibre over `y` realises the value.

Read off `epi_mapLin_of_polyhedralFn`: the point `(y, μ)` of `epi (Af)` is literally the image of a
point of `epi f`. -/

/-- **Theorem 20.1's companion for the image rule** (Rockafellar, §23, p. 222): a proper
*polyhedral* `g` pulls back exactly along `A` as soon as the range of `A` meets `dom g` — no
relative interior anywhere, exactly as on the sum side.

Nothing of §20 is used; the proof is entirely §19's, and it is the one Rockafellar points at when
he says that "the formula for `f*` in terms of `h*` can be obtained still from Theorem 16.3 via
Corollary 19.3.1". `g*` is polyhedral (**Theorem 19.2**), so `A' g*` is polyhedral
(**Corollary 19.3.1**) and therefore closed, and Theorem 16.3's *closure* formula
`conj_compLin_eq_clFn_mapLin` has nothing left to close. The same corollary attains the infimum
over the fibre, which is what `IsExactImage.exact_le` asks for.

Properness of `g` enters twice and cheaply: a proper polyhedral convex function is closed
(`PolyhedralFn.closedFn`), and `A x₀ ∈ dom g` keeps `dom (g A)` non-empty, which is what stops
`(g A)*` from being `-∞`. -/
