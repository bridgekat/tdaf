# The normal form of a polyhedral convex function

A polyhedral convex function is exactly a pointwise maximum of finitely many affine functions,
restricted to a polyhedral convex set: `f = h + δ(· | C)` with

`h x = max {⟨x, b₁⟩ - β₁, …, ⟨x, b_k⟩ - β_k}` and `C = {x | ⟨x, b_j⟩ ≤ β_j, j = k+1, …, m}`.

The two descriptions are the two kinds of closed half-space that can appear in a polyhedral
description of `epi f ⊆ E × ℝ`: those whose bounding hyperplane is *non-vertical*, which are the
epigraphs of affine functions, and those that are *vertical*, which constrain only `x`. There is
no third kind, because `epi f` is upward closed and so no constraint can bound the vertical
variable above; reading a polyhedral system for `epi f` off in the two groups is the whole proof.

## Main definitions

* `maxAffineFn s` — the pointwise maximum `x ↦ ⨆ q ∈ s, (q.1 x - q.2)` of a finite family of
  affine functions, valued in `EReal`. The empty family gives the constant `⊥`.

## Main results

* `polyhedralFn_maxAffineFn`, `polyhedralFn_maxAffineFn_add_indicatorFn` — a normal form is always
  polyhedral, with no hypothesis: the degenerate `s = ∅` gives `⊥`, whose epigraph is everything.
* `PolyhedralFn.exists_maxAffineFn_add_indicatorFn_dom` — every polyhedral convex function that
  nowhere takes `⊥` is in normal form, with `dom f` itself as the set. The vertical inequalities
  cut out a polyhedral set that may be strictly larger than `dom f`, but off `dom f` the function
  is `⊤` anyway.
* `polyhedralFn_iff_maxAffineFn_add_indicatorFn` — the two together, as an iff.

## Implementation notes

The `⊥`-freeness hypothesis is not decoration: `EReal` has `⊥ + ⊤ = ⊥`, so a normal form can take
the value `⊥` only on `C`. The function that is `⊥` on a proper nonempty polyhedral `C` and `⊤`
elsewhere is convex with polyhedral epigraph `C ×ˢ univ` and has no normal form. The classical
convention makes polyhedral convex functions proper, so `∀ x, f x ≠ ⊥` is the weaker hypothesis.
The forward direction needs no finite-dimensionality; only the converse uses Minkowski–Weyl,
through `PolyhedralFn.add`.

The affine pieces come from the *non-vertical* inequalities of a polyhedral system for `epi f`,
each rescaled by minus its (negative) coefficient on the vertical variable. The *vertical*
inequalities constrain `x` alone and hold throughout `dom f`, which is why `dom f` itself serves as
the set; it is polyhedral by `PolyhedralFn.polyhedral_dom`. No inequality can have a *positive*
