# The function determined by a set in `E × ℝ`

To build a convex function on `E`, build a convex set `F ⊆ E × ℝ` and take `ofEpi F`, the function
whose graph is the *lower boundary* of `F`: `ofEpi F x = inf {μ : ℝ | (x, μ) ∈ F}`, an infimum in
`EReal`, hence `⊤` over an empty vertical section and `⊥` over one unbounded below. This is the
single generator of Rockafellar §5 — infimal convolution, right scalar multiplication, the convex
hull of a family of functions, the image of a function under a linear map and the
lower-semicontinuous hull are all `ofEpi` of a set built from epigraphs — and it needs no structure
on `E` at all; only Theorem 5.3 itself needs a real vector space.

`epi (ofEpi F) = F` is false in general: only `F ⊆ epi (ofEpi F)` holds unconditionally, and
`IsEpiLike F` names the sets for which equality holds. That predicate is *not* preserved by the §5
operations that matter most — a sum of epigraphs need not be an epigraph, since an infimal
convolution need not attain its infimum, and neither need the convex hull of a union — so those
modules carry it as a hypothesis.

## Main results

* `subset_epi_iff_le_ofEpi` — the adjunction `F ⊆ epi g ↔ g ≤ ofEpi F`: `epi` and `ofEpi` form an
  antitone Galois connection (`gc_ofEpi_epi`, `epiClosure`) whose closed elements are the epi-like
  sets, and every order fact below is a formal consequence.
* `convexFn_ofEpi` — **Theorem 5.3**: `ofEpi F` is convex when `F` is.
* `ofEpi_epi` — `ofEpi (epi f) = f`, with no hypothesis; `epi_ofEpi` is the converse, under
  `IsEpiLike`.
* `IsEpiLike.iInter`, `.inter`, `.union`, `.of_isClosed`, `.closure` — the stability properties
  the §5 operations consume.

/-! ### Sets that are epigraphs -/

/-- `F ⊆ E × ℝ` is *epi-like* when it is the epigraph of some function `E → EReal`. Equivalently
(`isEpiLike_iff_forall`), every vertical section `{μ | (x, μ) ∈ F}` is upward closed and attains
its infimum — is `∅`, `ℝ`, or a closed half-line `Set.Ici c`.

This is the condition under which `epi (ofEpi F) = F`, and both halves of it are needed: it fails
for `{p | 0 < p.2}` (upward closed, does not attain) and for `{(0, 0)}` (attains, not upward
closed). The witness is always `ofEpi F` (`isEpiLike_iff`). -/
