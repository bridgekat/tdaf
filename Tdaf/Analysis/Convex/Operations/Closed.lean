# Closedness of the functional operations

The inverse image of a closed function under a continuous linear map is closed — the closedness
counterpart of `convexFn_compLin`, which is the convexity statement. The supporting
`lowerSemicontinuous_comp` precomposes a lower semicontinuous `g` with a continuous `φ`; Mathlib's
`Continuous.comp_lowerSemicontinuous` composes on the other side.

Closedness is not lower semicontinuity — `ClosedFn` also admits the constant `⊥` — and that branch
survives precomposition because `(fun _ => ⊥) ∘ A` is again constant.
