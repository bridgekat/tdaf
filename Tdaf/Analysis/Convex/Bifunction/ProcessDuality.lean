# The two inner products of a convex process

A convex process `A` carries two inner products,

  `⟨Au, x*⟩ = sup {⟨x, x*⟩ | x ∈ A u}`  and  `⟨u, A* x*⟩ = inf {⟨u, u*⟩ | u* ∈ A* x*}`,

the first a maximisation over a value of `A`, the second a minimisation over a value of `A*`. They
are the bracket and the concave bracket of the indicator bifunction of `A` and of its adjoint, so
everything that separates them is a partial closure. `Bifunction/Process.lean` proves the clauses
needing only the closure in `u`; this module adds those needing the closure in `x*` — where
closedness of `A` enters — and those needing relative interiors.

## Main results

* `ConvexProcess.closedBifun_indicatorBifun_iff` — `A` is a closed convex process exactly when its
  indicator bifunction is closed. `domConcaveBifun_adjointBifun_indicatorBifun`: `dom F* = dom A*`.
* `ConvexProcess.partialCl₂_concaveBracket_adjointBifun_indicatorBifun` —
  `⟨Au, x*⟩ = cl_{x*} ⟨u, A* x*⟩` for a closed convex process.
* `ConvexProcess.bracket_eq_concaveBracket_of_mem_relint_dom` and `…_of_mem_relint_dom_adjoint` —
  `⟨Au, x*⟩ = ⟨u, A* x*⟩` whenever `u ∈ ri (dom A)` or `x* ∈ ri (dom A*)` (Theorem 39.3 in [^1]);
  `bracket_eq_concaveBracket_adjointBifun_of_mem_relint_domConcaveBifun` is the dual half of that,
  for a general closed convex bifunction.
* `exists_unique_convexProcess_bracket_indicatorBifun_eq` — a lower closed concave-convex `K` with
  `K (0, 0) = 0` that is positively homogeneous in each variable separately is `⟨Au, x*⟩` for
  exactly one closed convex process `A` (Theorem 39.4 in [^1]). `ConvexProcess.isClosed_eval` and
  the `…_bracket_indicatorBifun` results beside it are the four properties it inverts.
* `ConvexProcess.closedFn_imageBifun_indicatorBifun` and the results beside it — for a closed
  convex process `A` and a closed proper convex `f`, the image `Af` is closed, the infimum defining
  `(Af)(x)` is attained, and `(Af)* = cl (A*⁻¹ f*)`. The open half is in `Bifunction/Process.lean`.

## Implementation notes

Rockafellar prefixes both halves of the last assertion with "if `A` is closed", but the `u` half
needs only that a concave function agrees with its concave closure on the relative interior of its
effective domain. Closedness is genuinely needed only on the `x*` side, where the closure in `x*` —
which rests on `F** = cl F` — identifies `cl_{x*} ⟨u, A* x*⟩` with `⟨Au, x*⟩`; there it is `Y`, not
`U`, that must be finite-dimensional.

A process is closed exactly when its indicator bifunction is, since `cl δ(· | S) = δ(· | cl S)`.
That is what lets the bifunction theorems be read for processes without a separate closedness
argument. The correspondence is stated as a `∃!` with closedness inside it: it is between *closed*
convex processes and kernels, so uniqueness is uniqueness among closed processes.

/-! ### Which saddle-functions are inner products of processes

The lower closed concave-convex functions on `U × Y` match the closed convex bifunctions from `U`
to `X`. Cutting that down to *processes* costs exactly two further conditions on `K`: it vanishes
at the origin, and it is positively homogeneous in each variable separately. -/

/-- **`K (u, x*) = ⟨Au, x*⟩` is a one-to-one correspondence** between the closed convex processes

`A u = {x | ⟨x, x*⟩ ≤ K (u, x*) for every x*}`
(`ConvexProcess.eval_eq_supportSet_bracket_indicatorBifun`).

The saddle-function correspondence does all the work on the bifunction side; what remains is that
the closed convex bifunction it produces is an indicator bifunction. `K (0, 0) = 0` bounds `F 0`
below by `0` and makes it finite somewhere, so the closed convex `graphFn F` cannot take `-∞`, and
no slice `K (u, ·)` is identically `+∞`. The conjugate of a positively homogeneous function that is
not identically `+∞` is an indicator function, so each `F u` is one; positive homogeneity in `u`
makes the resulting set a cone, its convexity coming from convexity of `F`. -/

/-- **For a closed convex process `A` and a closed proper convex `f`, the image `Af` is closed.**

This is `closedFn_imageBifun` at the indicator bifunction of `A`, the closedness hypothesis passing
through `closedBifun_indicatorBifun_iff` and the "finite somewhere" side condition being
`0 ∈ A 0`. Rockafellar's hypothesis `ri (dom f*) ∩ ri (dom A*⁻¹) ≠ ∅` is the `IsExactSum` there,
one instance per `x`; `dom A*⁻¹` is `range A*`. -/

/-- **Wherever `Af` is finite, the infimum `inf {f u | x ∈ A u}` is attained** at an actual `u`
with `x ∈ A u`.

The raw form `exists_imageBifun_indicatorBifun_eq` produces a `u` with
`f u + δ(x | A u) = (Af)(x)`; the indicator is `0` or `⊤`, and `⊤` is excluded because `f u ≠ ⊥`
would then force `(Af)(x) = ⊤`. -/
