# Exposed directions and the exposed representation of a closed convex set

An **exposed face** of a convex set `C` is the set on which some continuous linear functional
attains its maximum over `C`; an **exposed point** is a one-point exposed face, and an **exposed
direction** is the direction of an exposed face that is a closed half-line. Every exposed face is a
face, so exposed points are extreme points and exposed directions are extreme directions, but not
conversely.

The theorem proved here is that a closed convex set containing no lines is recovered from its
exposed points and exposed directions alone, up to closure: `C = cl (conv (exp C ∪ expdir C))`.
`Representation.lean` gives the same recovery from the *extreme* points and directions with no
closure at all; the closure is the price of passing to the smaller, exposed, data, and it cannot be
dropped, because the exposed points of a closed convex set need not be closed. The dual
representation — a closed convex set with nonempty interior is the intersection of the closed
half-spaces *tangent* to it — is in `Tangent.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `IsExposedDirection C y` — the direction of `y` is an *exposed direction* of `C`: some closed
  half-line in the direction of `y` is an exposed face of `C`. `exposedDirections C` is the set of
  vectors generating such directions, the analogue for `exposedPoints` of `IsExtremeDirection`.

## Main results

* `exists_forall_sub_le_mul_sub` — the multiplier for one linear equation: if `g ≤ γ` on the slice
  `C ∩ {f = β}`, and `f` takes values on both sides of `β` on `C`, then `g - γ ≤ c * (f - β)` on
  all of `C` for some `c`.
* `closure_convexHullPD_exposedPoints_exposedDirections` — the exposed representation of a
  line-free closed convex set.
* `closure_coneHull_exposedDirections`, `closure_coneHull_of_forall_exposedDirection` — the cone
  case: a line-free closed convex cone is the closure of the cone its exposed directions
  generate.
* `isExposed_recessionCone` — the recession cone of an exposed face is an exposed face of the
  recession cone, given that it is contained in it; the exposed analogue of `isFace_recessionCone`.
  `exposedDirections_subset_exposedDirections_recessionCone` is the consequence for closed `C`,
  and `isExposedDirection_recessionCone` its topology-free form.

## Implementation notes

The classical proof extends a codimension-two affine set to a supporting
hyperplane, which is really a multiplier: `exists_forall_sub_le_mul_sub` produces it by a
one-dimensional argument valid in every dimension. The final case split is then bounded/unbounded
rather than by the shape of a one-dimensional face — the bounded case is Minkowski's theorem in
every dimension, and only the unbounded case uses `dim C' ≤ 1`.

direction of `y` is an exposed face of `C`. Rockafellar's exposed direction — an "exposed point at

the cost of `exposedDirections C` being closed under multiplication by positive scalars. -/

/-- **A linear function dominated on a slice is dominated up to a multiple of the slicing
function.** If `g ≤ γ` wherever `f = β` on a convex set `C`, and `f` takes values strictly below
and strictly above `β` on `C`, then `g - γ ≤ c * (f - β)` on all of `C` for some scalar `c`.
Geometrically, the image of `C` under `z ↦ (f z - β, g z - γ)` misses the open upward vertical ray,
so it lies below a line through the origin, and `c` is that line's slope. This replaces the
"extend an `(n-2)`-dimensional affine set to a supporting hyperplane" step of the classical
proof, and needs no dimension hypothesis. -/

/-! ### The exposed representation of a line-free closed convex set -/

section Representation

  {C : Set E}

/-- **A closed convex set containing no lines is the closure of the convex hull of its exposed
points and exposed directions.** Unlike the extreme-point representation the closure cannot be
dropped — the exposed points of a closed convex set need not be closed, and Straszewicz's theorem
only places the extreme points in their closure.

Sketch: if the exposed hull `C₀` were not all of `C`, separate a point of `C \ C₀` from `C₀` by
`H = {f = β}`. The slice `C ∩ H` is a nonempty closed convex set containing no lines, so it has an
exposed point `x`, and `exists_forall_sub_le_mul_sub` turns its
exposing functional into one maximised over `C` at `x`. Its exposed face `C'` meets `H` only at
`x`, which forces `x ∈ ri C'` and `dim C' ≤ 1`; a bounded `C'` is then the hull of its extreme
points, an unbounded one a half-line whose direction is exposed, and either way `x ∈ C₀`. -/

directions.** The usual statement assumes the cone contains more than the origin; that is
unnecessary, since the zero cone has no exposed directions and
`PointedCone.hull ℝ ∅ = {0}`. -/
