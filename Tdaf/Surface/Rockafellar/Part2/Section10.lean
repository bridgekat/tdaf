# Rockafellar, §10: Continuity of Convex Functions

The situations in which a convex function is automatically upper semicontinuous, hence continuous,
together with the equi-Lipschitz and convergence theory that follows from them. All 13 numbered
results of §10 are formalized. The section is entirely finite-dimensional: every result rests on
Theorem 6.2 — a non-empty convex set has a non-empty relative interior — somewhere.

## The section's definitions

* **Continuity relative to `S`** is `ContinuousOn f S`, identified with continuity of the
  restriction — the book's own phrasing — by `continuousOn_iff_continuous_restrict_rn`.
* **Locally simplicial** is the backbone's `LocallySimplicial`, transcribed without change.
* **Lipschitzian relative to `S`** is `LipschitzianOn`, with the bridge `lipschitzianOn_iff`;
  **equi-Lipschitzian** is `EquiLipschitzianOn`, with `equiLipschitzianOn_iff` giving a single `K`
  for the whole family.
* **Pointwise bounded** and **uniformly bounded on `S`** are `PointwiseBoundedOn` and
  `UniformlyBoundedOn`, with bridges `pointwiseBoundedOn_iff` and `uniformlyBoundedOn_iff`.

`corollary_10_5_1` spells the book's `liminf_{λ → ∞} f (λ y) / λ < ∞` as "for some `c`,
`f (a y) ≤ c a` for arbitrarily large `a`", which avoids an `EReal` division convention; the two
agree because the quotient is nondecreasing in `λ` (Theorem 8.5). Hypothesis (a) of `theorem_10_6`
is stated with `cl C'` where the book writes `conv (cl C')`.

`theorem_10_2` is unconditional. Rockafellar's proof triangulates a simplex around an interior
point, a step he calls intuitively obvious and does not prove; upper semicontinuity relative to a
simplex is instead obtained at *every* point of it by a direct barycentric estimate, so §20
inherits no obligation from §10.

/-- **Theorem 10.2.** Let `f` be a convex function on `ℝⁿ`, and let `S` be any locally

not excluded; see the module docstring on the triangulation step the book leaves unproved. -/

/-- **Theorem 10.3.** Let `C` be a locally simplicial convex set, and let `f` be a
finite convex function on `ri C` which is bounded above on every bounded subset of `ri C`. Then `f`
can be extended to a continuous finite convex function on the whole of `C`.

"A finite convex function on `ri C`" is a convex `f : ℝⁿ → (-∞, +∞]` with `dom f = ri C`, which is
how §4 reads a function given only on a set. The extension produced is `cl f`. -/

Neither local simpliciality of `C` nor convexity of the two functions is needed. -/

/-- **Theorem 10.4.** Let `f` be a proper convex function, and let `S` be any closed
bounded subset of `ri (dom f)`. Then `f` is Lipschitzian relative to `S`. The Lipschitz condition
is about real values, so the statement is about `(f ·).toReal`, faithful on `dom f` by
properness. -/

/-- **Theorem 10.5.** Let `f` be a finite convex function on `ℝⁿ`. In order that `f`
be uniformly continuous relative to `ℝⁿ`, it is necessary and sufficient that the recession
function `f0⁺` be finite everywhere. "Finite everywhere" is spelled `≠ ⊤`; the other half,
`f0⁺ ≠ -∞`, is automatic from properness of `f`. -/

/-- **Corollary 10.5.1.** A finite convex function `f` is Lipschitzian relative to
`ℝⁿ` if `liminf_{λ → ∞} f (λ y) / λ < ∞` for every `y`. The `liminf` is spelled "for some `c`,
`f (a y) ≤ c a` for arbitrarily large `a`", avoiding the `EReal` quotient; the two agree because
the quotient is nondecreasing in `λ` (Theorem 8.5). -/

/-! ### Corollary 10.5.2 -/

/-- **Corollary 10.5.2.** Every finite convex `f` below a finite convex `g` that is Lipschitzian
relative to `ℝⁿ` is itself Lipschitzian relative to `ℝⁿ`. Convexity of `g` is carried so that the
statement is the book's; the estimate needs only that `g` is Lipschitz. -/

/-! ### Theorem 10.6 -/

/-- **Theorem 10.6.** Let `C` be a relatively open convex set, and let `{f i | i ∈ I}`
be an arbitrary collection of convex functions finite and pointwise bounded on `C`. Let `S` be any
closed bounded subset of `C`. Then `{f i}` is uniformly bounded on `S` and equi-Lipschitzian
relative to `S`.

"Relatively open" is `ri C = C`; "finite and convex on `C`" is Mathlib's real-valued `ConvexOn ℝ C`,
exactly as the book's collection is. `I` may be empty. -/

/-- **Theorem 10.6**, weakened hypotheses: the conclusion survives if pointwise
boundedness is replaced by

(a) a subset `C'` of `C` with `cl C' ⊇ C` on which `sup {f i x | i ∈ I}` is finite, and
(b) at least one `x ∈ C` at which `inf {f i x | i ∈ I}` is finite.

The book's (a) reads `conv (cl C') ⊇ C`, which is weaker than the `cl C' ⊇ C` used here. -/

/-! ### Theorem 10.9 -/

/-- **Theorem 10.9.** Let `C` be a relatively open convex set and `f 1, f 2, …` a
sequence of finite convex functions on `C` whose values are bounded at each point of a dense subset
`C'` of `C`. It is then possible to select a subsequence converging uniformly on closed bounded
subsets of `C` to some finite convex function `f`. -/
