# Rockafellar, §9: Some Closedness Criteria

Criteria, built on §8's recession cones, for an operation on convex sets or convex functions to
preserve closedness. The section introduces no new concepts. All 18 numbered results of §9 are
formalized.

Where the book states a result for `C₁, …, Cₘ` (or `f₁, …, fₘ`) — Corollaries 9.1.1, 9.1.3 and
9.2.1, Theorem 9.3, and Theorem 9.8 with its corollaries — what is stated here is the `m = 2`
instance.

## The `λ ≥ 0⁺` convention

Rockafellar writes `λ₁C₁ + ⋯ + λₘCₘ` where each `λᵢ` ranges over the non-negative reals *together
with a formal symbol* `0⁺`, and where `0⁺Cᵢ` denotes the recession cone rather than the `{0}` that
plain `0 • Cᵢ` would give. The same convention governs the infimum in Theorem 9.7, where `f0⁺` is
the recession *function*.

That is a genuine extra symbol, not a limit, and it is modelled here as one: `ExtCoeff` is the
disjoint union of `ℝ` and a formal `0⁺`, with `ExtCoeff.smulSet` acting on sets and
`ExtCoeff.smulFn` on functions, each carrying its bridge to the backbone
(`ExtCoeff.smulSet_ofReal`, `ExtCoeff.smulSet_zeroPlus`, and the two `smulFn` analogues). Every
theorem below reduces to the backbone form rather than unfolding the convention;
`iUnion_extCoeff_pair` is where that reduction has content, identifying Rockafellar's
`⋃ {λ₁C₁ + λ₂C₂ | λᵢ ≥ 0⁺, λ₁ + λ₂ = 1}` with `conv (C₁ ∪ C₂) + (0⁺C₁ + 0⁺C₂)`.

transformation from `ℝⁿ` to `ℝᵐ`. Assume that every non-zero `z ∈ 0⁺(cl C)` with `Az = 0` belongs
to the lineality space of `cl C`. Then `cl (AC) = A (cl C)`. `C` need not be non-empty. -/

/-- **Corollary 9.1.3** for `m = 2`. For convex cones the recession cone of the
closure is the closure itself, so Corollary 9.1.1's hypothesis becomes a hypothesis about
`cl K₁` and `cl K₂`, and `cl (K₁ + K₂) = cl K₁ + cl K₂`. -/

/-! ### Theorem 9.2 and its corollaries -/

/-- **Theorem 9.2.** Let `h` be a closed proper convex function on `ℝⁿ` and `A` a
linear transformation from `ℝⁿ` to `ℝᵐ`. Assume `Az ≠ 0` for every `z` with `(h0⁺)(z) ≤ 0` and
`(h0⁺)(-z) > 0`. Then `Ah`, where `(Ah)(y) = inf {h x | A x = y}`, is a closed proper convex
function.

The hypothesis is transported by `mk_zero_mem_linealitySpace_epi_iff`: "`(h0⁺)(z) ≤ 0` and
`(h0⁺)(-z) > 0` force `Az ≠ 0`" is the contrapositive of "`(h0⁺)(z) ≤ 0` and `Az = 0` force
`z ∈ constancySpace h`". -/

/-- Rockafellar's hypothesis in Corollary 9.2.1, at `m = 2`, in the shape the backbone takes it:
the directions `z` with `(f₁0⁺)(z) + (f₂0⁺)(-z) ≤ 0` form a symmetric set. The two are equivalent,
because `z₁ + z₂ = 0` says exactly that `z₂ = -z₁`. -/

`(f₁0⁺)(z₁) + (f₂0⁺)(z₂) ≤ 0` and `(f₁0⁺)(-z₁) + (f₂0⁺)(-z₂) > 0`.

Then the infimal convolute `f₁ □ f₂` is a closed proper convex function.

This is genuinely weaker in hypothesis than Corollary 9.2.2, which demands
`(f₁0⁺)(z) + (f₂0⁺)(-z) > 0` for every `z ≠ 0`: here `f₁ = f₂ = 0` is admitted, there not. -/

Rockafellar's `⋃ {λ₁C₁ + λ₂C₂ | λᵢ ≥ 0⁺, λ₁ + λ₂ = 1}` is exactly
`conv (C₁ ∪ C₂) + (0⁺C₁ + 0⁺C₂)`.

Both `λᵢ = 0⁺` is excluded by `λ₁ + λ₂ = 1`; the mixed cases give the summands `0⁺C₁ + C₂` and
`C₁ + 0⁺C₂`; and with both `λᵢ` real and positive the recession cones are absorbed, since
`Cᵢ + 0⁺Cᵢ = Cᵢ`. -/
