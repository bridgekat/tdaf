# Rockafellar, §7: Closures of Convex Functions

R. T. Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis* (Princeton, 1970), §7, pp. 51–59: lower semicontinuity, the
lower semicontinuous hull, the closure `cl f` of a convex function, and closed convex functions.
Every numbered result of the section is here, stated in the book's own terms over
`Rn n = ℝⁿ` with extended-real values, and closed by specialising the backbone.

## Contents

| label | declaration |
|---|---|
| Theorem 7.1 | `theorem_7_1` — lsc ↔ closed level sets ↔ closed epigraph |
| Theorem 7.2 | `theorem_7_2` — an improper convex function is `−∞` on `ri (dom f)` |
| Corollary 7.2.1 | `corollary_7_2_1` — a lsc improper convex function has no finite values |
| Corollary 7.2.2 | `corollary_7_2_2` — `cl f` for improper `f` |
| Corollary 7.2.3 | `corollary_7_2_3` — relatively open effective domain |
| Lemma 7.3 | `lemma_7_3` — `ri (epi f)` |
| Corollary 7.3.1 | `corollary_7_3_1` |
| Corollary 7.3.2 | `corollary_7_3_2` |
| Corollary 7.3.3 | `corollary_7_3_3` |
| Corollary 7.3.4 | `corollary_7_3_4` — `cl f` depends only on `f` on `ri (dom f)` |
| Theorem 7.4 | `theorem_7_4` — `cl f` is a closed proper convex function |
| Corollary 7.4.1 | `corollary_7_4_1` — `dom (cl f)` versus `dom f` |
| Corollary 7.4.2 | `corollary_7_4_2` — an affine effective domain forces closedness |
| Theorem 7.5 | `theorem_7_5`, `theorem_7_5_improper` — `cl f` as a limit along a segment |
| Corollary 7.5.1 | `corollary_7_5_1` |
| Theorem 7.6 | `theorem_7_6` — closures, relative interiors and dimensions of level sets |
| Corollary 7.6.1 | `corollary_7_6_1` |

The section's *definitions* are recorded alongside: lower semicontinuity is Mathlib's
`LowerSemicontinuous`, the lower semicontinuous hull is `lscHull` (`lscHull_isGreatest` is the
book's characterisation of it as the greatest lsc minorant), the closure of a convex function is
`clFn`, and a closed convex function is one with `ClosedFn f`. Two unnumbered claims of the text
are recorded as `closedFn_iff_lowerSemicontinuous_of_proper` ("for a proper convex function,
closedness is the same as lower semicontinuity") and `closed_improper_eq_const` ("the only closed
improper convex functions are the constant functions `+∞` and `−∞`").

## The `cl f` case split, and the book's slip about `epi (cl f)`

Rockafellar defines `cl f` by cases (p. 52): the lower semicontinuous hull when `f` is nowhere
`−∞`, and the constant `−∞` otherwise. The backbone's `clFn` branches on the *hull* taking `−∞`
rather than on `f` doing so, which is the standard Γ-regularisation and the only branch that keeps
`f** = cl f` true; `ConvexFn.clFn_eq_lscHull` (`RelativeInterior.lean`) is the proof that the two
descriptions agree, and it is cited here rather than reproved.

The book then asserts `epi (cl f) = cl (epi f)` "by definition" (p. 52). **That is false for
improper `f`**: when `f` takes the value `−∞`, `cl f ≡ −∞` and `epi (cl f)` is all of `ℝⁿ⁺¹`,
while `cl (epi f)` is `cl (dom f) × ℝ`. The identity holds for the *hull* with no hypothesis at
all (`epi_lscHull`), and for `cl f` exactly when `f` is proper. No statement below inherits the
slip: every use of it here goes through `epi_lscHull` or through properness.

## What is not here

* **The dimension bookkeeping helpers `dim_eq_of_affineSpan_eq` and `dim_eq_of_closure_eq` are
  §6's, not §7's** — the second is Rockafellar's Corollary 6.3.1 ("`cl C` and `ri C` have the same
  affine hull, hence the same dimension as `C`"), needed here by `corollary_7_4_1`.
  `Section06.lean` is being written in parallel and is not importable; the merge should
  de-duplicate. `affineSpan_relint_dom_lt`, the step Theorem 7.6's dimension clause needs, is
  proved here directly rather than through the slice dimension count of Theorem 6.8 that
  Rockafellar invokes, which the backbone does not carry.
* **The worked examples** — *omitted*. The four unnumbered illustrations (the closure of the
  half-line indicator, the disk with arbitrary boundary values, `f x = -(1 - |x|²)^{1/2}`, and
  `f x = 1/x` as a closed function with a non-closed effective domain) are computations in fixed
  low dimensions rather than statements of the theory.
* **The non-convex counterexample after Corollary 7.6.1** — *omitted*. The book exhibits a lsc
  non-convex `f : ℝ → ℝ` with convex level sets for which the two formulas of Corollary 7.6.1
  fail. Nothing later in the book cites it.
* **The application of Corollary 7.2.3 to `g ξ₁ = inf_{ξ₂} f (ξ₁, ξ₂)`** — *deferred by scope*.
  It is an illustration resting on the partial-infimum construction of §5, and it needs the
  transport between `Rn 2` and `Rn 1 × Rn 1`, which `Section05.lean` deliberately does not
  attempt.

`not_proper_clFn` is the converse of `ConvexFn.proper_clFn`; `dim_eq_of_affineSpan_eq` and

Rockafellar's Corollary 6.3.1. All three are recorded as backbone gaps; none is a §7 statement. -/

used: `clFn f ≤ f` transfers the value `−∞`, and `dom (cl f) ⊆ cl (dom f)` transfers emptiness of

(c) the epigraph of `f` is a closed set in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`.

/-! ### Theorem 7.2 and its corollaries -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 7.2.** If `f` is an improper convex function, then `f x = -∞` for every
`x ∈ ri (dom f)`. Thus an improper convex function is necessarily infinite except perhaps at
relative boundary points of its effective domain.

Specialises `ConvexFn.eq_bot_of_mem_relint_dom`. No properness hypothesis is added: the theorem is
*about* improper functions. -/

    f x = ⊥ :=
  hf.eq_bot_of_mem_relint_dom himp hx

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.2.1.** A lower semi-continuous improper convex function can have no
finite values.

Rockafellar's own proof: the set where `f = -∞` includes `cl (ri (dom f)) = cl (dom f) ⊇ dom f`
(`ConvexFn.eq_bot_of_mem_closure_dom`), and off `cl (dom f)` the value is `+∞`. -/

  · refine Or.inr ?_
    by_contra h
    exact hx (subset_closure (mem_dom.2 (lt_of_le_of_ne le_top h)))

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.2.2.** Let `f` be an improper convex function. Then `cl f` is a
closed improper convex function which agrees with `f` on `ri (dom f)`.

Specialises `convexFn_clFn`, `closedFn_clFn`, `not_proper_clFn` and
`ConvexFn.clFn_eq_of_mem_relint_dom`. Note that the agreement is *not* obtained from
`epi (cl f) = cl (epi f)`, which fails exactly in this improper case. -/
theorem corollary_7_2_2 (hf : ConvexFn f) (himp : ¬ Proper f) :
    ConvexFn (clFn f) ∧ ClosedFn (clFn f) ∧ ¬ Proper (clFn f) ∧

  ⟨convexFn_clFn hf, closedFn_clFn f, not_proper_clFn himp,
    fun _ hx => hf.clFn_eq_of_mem_relint_dom hx⟩

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.2.3.** If `f` is a convex function whose effective domain is
relatively open (for instance if `dom f = ℝⁿ`), then either `f x > -∞` for every `x`, or `f x` is
infinite for every `x`.

  hf.forall_ne_bot_or_forall_infinite hopen

/-! ### Lemma 7.3 and its corollaries -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Lemma 7.3.** For any convex function `f`, `ri (epi f)` consists of the pairs
`(x, μ)` such that `x ∈ ri (dom f)` and `f x < μ < ∞`.

Specialises `ConvexFn.relint_epi`. The book's `μ < ∞` is carried by the type: the second component
of a point of `ℝⁿ⁺¹ = Rn n × ℝ` is a real number. -/
theorem lemma_7_3 (hf : ConvexFn f) :
    ri (epi f) = {p : Rn n × ℝ | p.1 ∈ ri (dom f) ∧ f p.1 < (p.2 : EReal)} :=
  hf.relint_epi

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.3.1.** Let `α` be a real number, and let `f` be a convex function
such that, for some `x`, `f x < α`. Then actually `f x < α` for some `x ∈ ri (dom f)`.

Specialises `ConvexFn.exists_mem_relint_dom_lt`. -/
theorem corollary_7_3_1 (hf : ConvexFn f) {α : ℝ} (h : ∃ x, f x < (α : EReal)) :
    ∃ x ∈ ri (dom f), f x < (α : EReal) :=
  hf.exists_mem_relint_dom_lt h

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.3.2.** Let `f` be a convex function, and let `C` be a convex set
such that `ri C ⊆ dom f`. Let `α` be a real number such that `f x < α` for some `x ∈ cl C`. Then
actually `f x < α` for some `x ∈ ri C`.

Rockafellar's own proof: restrict `f` to `cl C` (the backbone's `restrict`), whose effective
domain is squeezed between `ri C` and `cl C` and therefore has relative interior `ri C`, and apply
Corollary 7.3.1 to the restriction. -/

    (hsub : ri C ⊆ dom f) {α : ℝ} (h : ∃ x ∈ closure C, f x < (α : EReal)) :

  rw [hri] at hz
  rw [restrict_of_mem (subset_closure (intrinsicInterior_subset hz))] at hzα
  exact ⟨z, hz, hzα⟩

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.3.3.** Let `f` be a convex function on `ℝⁿ`, and let `C` be a
convex set on which `f` is finite. If `f x ≥ α` for every `x ∈ C`, then also `f x ≥ α` for every
`x ∈ cl C`.

Rockafellar's proof is "obvious from the preceding corollary", and so it is: negate the
conclusion, feed `x ∈ cl C` to Corollary 7.3.2, and contradict the bound at the resulting point of
`ri C ⊆ C`. Going through Corollary 7.3.2 is what makes the statement come out in the book's own
form; the backbone's `ConvexFn.le_of_mem_closure` proves it directly but has to assume
`∀ z, f z ≠ ⊥` globally, which the book does not. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.3.4.** If `f` and `g` are convex functions on `ℝⁿ` such that
`ri (dom f) = ri (dom g)` and `f` and `g` agree on the latter set, then `cl f = cl g`.

Rockafellar's proof: Lemma 7.3 turns the hypothesis into `ri (epi f) = ri (epi g)`, Theorem 6.3
turns that into `cl (epi f) = cl (epi g)`, and the hull is determined by the closed epigraph
(`epi_lscHull` and `epi_injective`). The book then has to treat improper `f` separately, because
it reads the last step off `epi (cl f) = cl (epi f)`; here no such split is needed, since `clFn` is
a function of `lscHull` alone. -/

/-! ### Theorem 7.4 and its corollaries -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 7.4.** Let `f` be a proper convex function on `ℝⁿ`. Then `cl f` is a
closed proper convex function. Moreover, `cl f` agrees with `f` except perhaps at relative
boundary points of `dom f` — that is, off `cl (dom f) \ ri (dom f)`.

Specialises `convexFn_clFn`, `closedFn_clFn`, `ConvexFn.proper_clFn`,
`ConvexFn.clFn_eq_of_mem_relint_dom` and `ConvexFn.clFn_eq_of_notMem_closure_dom`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.4.1.** If `f` is a proper convex function, then `dom (cl f)`
differs from `dom f` at most by including some additional relative boundary points of `dom f`. In
particular, `dom (cl f)` and `dom f` have the same closure and relative interior, as well as the
same dimension.

Specialises `dom_subset_dom_lscHull`, `dom_lscHull_subset_closure_dom`,
`Convex.closure_eq_of_relint_subset_of_subset_closure` and `ConvexFn.relint_dom_clFn`; the

/-! ### Theorem 7.5 and its corollary -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 7.5.** Let `f` be a proper convex function, and let `x ∈ ri (dom f)`.
Then `(cl f) y = lim_{λ ↑ 1} f ((1 - λ) x + λ y)` for every `y`.

Specialises `ConvexFn.tendsto_clFn_along_segment_relint`. The book's `λ ↑ 1` is the filter

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 7.5**, the parenthetical clause: "the formula is also valid when `f` is
improper and `y ∈ cl (dom f)`".

Rockafellar's own argument: by Theorem 6.1 the half-open segment from `x ∈ ri (dom f)` towards
`y ∈ cl (dom f)` stays in `ri (dom f)`, where Theorem 7.2 makes `f` equal to `-∞`, while `cl f` is
the constant `-∞`. The restriction to `y ∈ cl (dom f)` is not decorative: off `cl (dom f)` the
function along the segment is eventually `+∞`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.5.1.** For a closed proper convex function `f`, one has
`f y = lim_{λ ↑ 1} f ((1 - λ) x + λ y)` for every `x ∈ dom f` and every `y`.

Specialises `tendsto_along_segment_of_closed_proper`. The backbone proves this directly rather
than through Theorem 7.5 and a restriction to a line, so no relative interiors appear. -/

/-! ### Theorem 7.6 and its corollary -/

/-- The step Rockafellar takes by a slice dimension count: for `α` above the infimum of a convex
`f`, the set `{x ∈ ri (dom f) | f x < α}` has the same affine hull as `dom f`, and therefore the
same dimension.

The direct argument is the line segment principle. `ri (dom f)` already spans `aff (dom f)`
(Theorem 6.2), so it is enough to reach every `x ∈ ri (dom f)` from the set; and given a point `y`
of the set (Corollary 7.3.1), a short enough step from `y` towards `x` lands back in it, because
the convexity inequality keeps the value below `α`. Prolonging that step past `x` is
`combo_prolong`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 7.6.** Let `f` be any proper convex function, and let `α ∈ R`,
`α > inf f`. The convex level sets `{x | f x ≤ α}` and `{x | f x < α}` then have the same closure
and the same relative interior, namely `{x | (cl f) x ≤ α}` and `{x ∈ ri (dom f) | f x < α}`
respectively.

Furthermore, they have the same dimension as `dom f`.

`ConvexFn.relint_setOf_le` and `ConvexFn.relint_setOf_lt`; the dimension clause is
`affineSpan_relint_dom_lt` together with Theorem 6.2 (`Convex.affineSpan_relint`). -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 7.6.1.** If `f` is a closed proper convex function whose effective
domain is relatively open (in particular if `dom f` is an affine set), then for
`inf f < α < +∞` one has `ri {x | f x ≤ α} = {x | f x < α}` and
`cl {x | f x < α} = {x | f x ≤ α}`.

Specialises `ConvexFn.relint_setOf_le_of_relint_dom_eq` and
`ConvexFn.closure_setOf_lt_of_closedFn`. The book's `α < +∞` is carried by `α : ℝ`. The two
hypotheses split: the first formula needs only relative openness of `dom f`, and the second only
closedness. -/
