# Rockafellar, §13: Support Functions

R. T. Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis* (Princeton, 1970), §13, pp. 112–120: the support function
`δ*(· | C)` of a convex set, the one-to-one correspondence between closed convex sets and closed
proper positively homogeneous convex functions, and the derivation of the support functions of
`dom f`, `dom f*` and of a level set `{x | f x ≤ 0}` from the conjugate `f*`.

All fifteen numbered results are here, stated over `Rn n = ℝⁿ` and closed by specialising
`Tdaf/Analysis/Convex/Duality/{Support, SupportRelint, Level, Barrier}.lean` and
`Recession/Conjugate.lean`.

## The section's definitions

* **The support function** `δ*(x* | C) = sup {⟨x, x*⟩ | x ∈ C}` is the backbone's `supportFn`, and
  `supportFn_apply_rn` records that it is the book's formula verbatim.
* **The barrier cone** of `C` (p. 112) is `dom δ*(· | C)`, recorded as `barrierCone` with the
  bridge `barrierCone_eq_dom_supportFn` and the unfolded form `mem_barrierCone_iff`.
* **Co-finite** (p. 116) is the backbone's `Cofinite`: closed, proper, convex, and `f0⁺ = +∞` in
  every non-zero direction — the epigraph contains no non-vertical half-line.
* **Rank** (§8, p. 70) is `rankFn f = dim (dom f) - lineality f`, defined here because §8's surface
  deferred it for want of §1's affine-hull dimension `dim`; Corollary 13.4.1 is its first consumer.

## The unnumbered running text

Recorded: the infimum formula `inf {⟨x, x*⟩ | x ∈ C} = -δ*(-x* | C)`
(`infimum_eq_neg_supportFn_neg`); the half-space description `C ⊆ {x | ⟨x, x*⟩ ≤ β} ↔ β ≥ δ*(x*|C)`
(`subset_halfspace_iff`); the invariance `δ*(·|C) = δ*(·|cl C) = δ*(·|ri C)`
(`supportFn_closure_rn`, `supportFn_relint_rn`); the additivity `δ*(·|C₁+C₂) = δ*(·|C₁)+δ*(·|C₂)`
(`supportFn_add_rn`); the recovery of a closed convex set from its support function
(`eq_setOf_le_supportFn`); the subadditivity noted after Theorem 13.2
(`theorem_13_2_subadditive`); and the Euclidean-norm example `|x| = δ*(x | B)` together with its
translate-and-scale form (`supportFn_unitBall`, `supportFn_ball`).

## What is not here

* **The example table `δ*(·|C₁)`–`δ*(·|C₄)`** (book, lines 4528–4561) — *omitted with a reason*.
  Four coordinatewise computations — the simplex, the cross-polytope, a hyperbolic region and a
  parabolic region — carried out "readily" in the book with no argument printed. None is used
  later, and none tests the backbone: they exercise `Fin n` arithmetic and one-variable calculus,
  not convex analysis.
* **The "elliptic" set worked example** (book, lines 4722–4753) — *omitted with a reason*. It is
  Theorem 13.5 (`theorem_13_5`) plus §12's quadratic conjugate plus the minimisation of
  `λ ↦ (2λ)⁻¹⟨x*, Q⁻¹x*⟩ + ⟨b, x*⟩ + λβ` over `λ > 0`. The first is here, the second is §12's, and
  the third is calculus.
* **`Q′`, the pseudo-inverse of §12** — *deferred by scope*: §12's business, not §13's.
* **The remark that gauge functions are positively homogeneous too** (book, line 4563) — *deferred
  by scope* to §14/§15, where gauges are defined.
* **The three-case formula for `k (λ, x)` in Corollary 13.5.1** — *deferred by scope*.
  `corollary_13_5_1` states the conclusion for `cl (hom f)`; identifying that with the book's
  display is **Corollary 8.5.2**, a §8 statement, and the backbone records the same split.

/-- **Rockafellar's support function** (§13, p. 112): `δ*(x* | C) = sup {⟨x, x*⟩ | x ∈ C}`.

This is the backbone's `supportFn (pairing n) C`, and the equation is the definition unfolded. -/

directions in which a linear function is bounded above on `C`. -/

epigraph contains no non-vertical half-line, i.e. with `(f0⁺)(y) = +∞` for every `y ≠ 0`.

    fun h => { h.1 with recessionFn_eq_top := h.2 }⟩

/-- **Rockafellar's rank of a convex function** (§8, p. 70): `rank f = dim f - lineality f`, where
`dim f` is the dimension of `dom f` and the lineality of `f` is the dimension of its lineality
space.

§8's surface module deferred `rank` for want of §1's `dim`; Corollary 13.4.1 is the first result
that needs it, so it is defined here. -/

/-! ### Properness of the conjugate

Rockafellar states Theorems 13.3 and 13.4 for a *proper convex* `f`; the backbone asks in addition
that `f*` be proper, which in `ℝⁿ` is automatic — Theorem 12.2, through Theorem 7.4. -/

/-- In `ℝⁿ` the conjugate of a proper convex function is proper: `f*` is `(cl f)*`, and `cl f` is
closed proper convex by Theorem 7.4. -/

for every `x* ≠ 0`.

without it — over the zero space the condition is vacuous while `int ∅ = ∅`. -/

of a closed convex set are conjugate to each other.

Specialises `conj_supportFn`. -/

  exact conj_supportFn hC hCcl

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 13.2**, second assertion: the functions which are the support functions
of non-empty convex sets are exactly the closed proper convex functions which are positively
homogeneous.

Specialises `exists_supportFn_iff`. Since `δ*` sees neither the closure nor the convex hull, the
class of sets may be narrowed to the non-empty *closed convex* ones, and that is what makes the
correspondence one-to-one. -/

convex sets in `ℝⁿ` and objects of quite a different sort, certain functions on `ℝⁿ`".

not identically `+∞`. Then `cl f` is the support function of the closed convex set
`C = {x* | ∀ x, ⟨x, x*⟩ ≤ f x}`.

Specialises `clFn_eq_supportFn_of_posHomogeneous`. The improper case is included: if `f` takes
`-∞` then `cl f ≡ -∞`, `C` is empty, and both sides are `δ*(· | ∅)`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 13.2.2.** The support functions of the non-empty bounded convex sets
are the finite positively homogeneous convex functions.

Specialises `exists_supportFn_finite_iff` together with `isBounded_iff_forall_bddAbove`, which
turns the pairing-sense boundedness of the general statement into boundedness in the norm.
**`ClosedFn` is not redundant in the backbone's general form** — a discontinuous linear functional
is finite, convex and positively homogeneous without being a support function — but in `ℝⁿ` it is
free, by Corollary 7.4.2, which is why the book does not state it. -/

function of `dom f` is the recession function `f*0⁺` of `f*`.

Specialises `recessionFn_conj`; the extra properness hypothesis the backbone carries is discharged
here by `proper_conj_of_proper`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 13.3.1.** Let `f` be a closed convex function on `ℝⁿ`. In order that
`f*` be finite everywhere, so that `dom f* = ℝⁿ`, it is necessary and sufficient that `f` be
co-finite.

/-! ### Corollary 13.3.2

The book delegates the key step — "as an exercise in separation theory, it can be shown that a
convex set `C` is affine if and only if every linear function which is bounded above on `C` is
constant on `C`" — and it is recovered here as `affine_iff_forall_reversible`. No separation is
needed beyond what Theorem 13.1 already supplies: one direction runs a line inside the affine set
against the bound, the other reads Theorem 13.1's `aff` and `cl` clauses against each other and
closes with Theorem 6.1's line-segment principle. -/

/-- **The step Rockafellar leaves as an exercise** (book, line 4591): a non-empty convex set `C` is
affine if and only if every linear function bounded above on `C` is constant on it — that is, if
and only if `-δ*(-x* | C) = δ*(x* | C)` whenever `δ*(x* | C) < +∞`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 13.3.2.** Let `f` be a closed proper convex function. In order that
`dom f*` be an affine set, it is necessary and sufficient that `(f0⁺)(y) = +∞` for every `y` which
is not actually in the lineality space of `f`.

The book's proof delegates its main step to the reader; it is `affine_iff_forall_reversible` above,
applied to `C = dom f*` through Theorem 13.3 (`theorem_13_3_dual`), which identifies
`δ*(· | dom f*)` with `f0⁺` and hence the reversible directions with the lineality space of `f`. -/

/-! ### Corollary 13.3.3 -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Corollary 13.3.3**, the quantitative half: for `α ≥ 0`, the Lipschitz condition
`f(z) ≤ f(x) + α|z - x|` holds for all `x` and `z` exactly when `dom f*` is contained in the ball
of radius `α`. This is what "the smallest such `α` is `sup {|x*| : x* ∈ dom f*}`" means.

Corollary 8.5.1 (`recessionFn_isLeast`) turns the Lipschitz condition into `f0⁺ ≤ α|·|`; Theorem
13.3 identifies `f0⁺` with `δ*(· | dom f*)`; `α|·|` is `δ*(· | αB)` (`supportFn_closedBall`); and
Corollary 13.1.1 turns the inequality of support functions into the inclusion of closures. -/

/-! ### Corollary 13.3.4

The book sets `g (x) = f (x) - ⟨x, x*⟩`, so that `(g0⁺)(y) = (f0⁺)(y) - ⟨y, x*⟩`; the four clauses
below are stated through `f0⁺` and `⟨y, x*⟩` directly, which makes the translation by `-x*`
disappear. Rockafellar's exception set in (b) is `y`-independent for this reason. -/
