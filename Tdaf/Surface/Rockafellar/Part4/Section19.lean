# Rockafellar, §19: Polyhedral Convex Sets and Functions

The Minkowski–Weyl theorem and the polyhedral calculus, over `Rn n = ℝⁿ`.

All seventeen numbered results of §19 are formalized: Theorems 19.1–19.7 and Corollaries 19.1.1,
19.1.2, 19.2.1, 19.2.2, 19.3.1–19.3.4, 19.5.1, 19.7.1, together with the unnumbered normal form
`f = h + δ(· | C)`.

The section's five notions are the backbone's. A **polyhedral convex set** is `Polyhedral`, the
solution set of finitely many weak linear inequalities; a **polyhedral convex cone** is
`PolyhedralCone`; a **finitely generated convex set** is `FinitelyGenerated`, that is `convexHullPD`
of a finite set of points and directions; a **polytope** is `IsPolytope`, a bounded set of either
kind; and a **polyhedral convex function** is `PolyhedralFn f := Polyhedral (epi f)`, with
`FinitelyGeneratedFn` its generated twin.

Theorems 19.6 and 19.7 and Corollary 19.5.1 use Rockafellar's extended coefficient `λ ≥ 0⁺`,
modelled by §9's `ExtCoeff`: `ExtCoeff.smulSet` sends `0⁺` to the recession cone and
`ExtCoeff.smulFn` to the recession function.

Every statement of §19 is correct as printed; two of its proofs are not. Theorem 19.1's
(b) ⇒ (a) reduces without justification to the `n`-dimensional case, and is proved here through
clause (c) instead; Theorem 19.6 is printed with no proof paragraph at all.

/-! ### The book's spellings of the two definitions -/

/-- **§19**: a **polytope** is a bounded finitely generated convex set — equivalently
(`isPolytope_iff`) a bounded polyhedral convex set. -/
def IsPolytope (C : Set (Rn n)) : Prop := ∃ P : Finset (Rn n), C = convexHull ℝ (P : Set (Rn n))

/-- **§19**: a convex function is **finitely generated** when its epigraph is a finitely generated
convex set in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`. The book defines it by an infimum formula and then observes, before Corollary
19.1.2, that this says `f x = inf {μ | (x, μ) ∈ F}` for `F` the hull of the points `(aᵢ, αᵢ)`,
their directions and the direction `(0, 1)`; the generator `(0, 1)` is absorbed here into the
requirement that the generated set be an epigraph. -/
def FinitelyGeneratedFn (f : Rn n → EReal) : Prop := FinitelyGenerated (epi f)

/-- A polytope is exactly a bounded polyhedral convex set. -/

/-! ### Theorem 19.1 -/

/-- **Theorem 19.1** (Minkowski–Weyl), clauses (a) and (c): a convex set is *polyhedral* — an
intersection of finitely many closed half-spaces — iff it is *finitely generated*, the convex hull
of a finite set of points and directions. -/
theorem theorem_19_1 {C : Set (Rn n)} : Polyhedral C ↔ FinitelyGenerated C :=
  polyhedral_iff_finitelyGenerated

/-- **Theorem 19.1**, clause (a) in the book's notation: `C` is polyhedral exactly when it solves a
finite system `⟨x, bᵢ⟩ ≤ βᵢ` in *vectors* `bᵢ`. The backbone quantifies over linear functionals,
which the pairing represents on `ℝⁿ`. -/

`C = conv S` for a finite set `S` of points and directions. -/

/-- **Theorem 19.1**, (b) ⇒ (a): a closed convex set with finitely many faces is polyhedral.

**The book's proof of this implication has a hole**: it writes "it suffices to treat the case where
`C` is `n`-dimensional in `Rⁿ`" with no justification, then runs the tangent half-spaces of Theorem
18.8 over that case. The route taken here avoids the reduction — (b) ⇒ (c) ⇒ (a) — and never uses
Theorem 18.8 or counts a dimension. -/

finitely many faces. With `theorem_19_1` this completes the three-way statement. -/

theorem corollary_19_1_1_extremePoints {C : Set (Rn n)} (hC : Polyhedral C) :
    (C.extremePoints ℝ).Finite :=
  hC.finitelyGenerated.finite_extremePoints

/-- **Corollary 19.1.1**, the directions half: a polyhedral convex set has finitely many extreme
directions. This cannot read `(extremeDirections C).Finite`: a direction is recorded by a
generating vector, so `extremeDirections C` is closed under positive rescaling and is infinite as
soon as it is non-empty. The finiteness is stated up to positive scaling, which is what the book
means. -/

/-- **Corollary 19.1.2**, second sentence: a proper polyhedral convex function is closed.
Properness cannot be dropped: `f ≡ ⊥` has epigraph `ℝⁿ⁺¹`, polyhedral by the empty system, and is

/-- **Corollary 19.3.3**. Two disjoint polyhedral convex sets can be separated strongly. The
book's non-emptiness hypotheses are kept because the book has them, but are not used: `C₁ - C₂` is
polyhedral hence closed, and Theorem 11.4 applies. -/

/-! ### Theorem 19.4 -/

/-- **Theorem 19.4**. A sum of two proper polyhedral convex functions is polyhedral. Properness
enters only as `∀ x, fᵢ x ≠ ⊥`, which is what makes the `EReal` splitting
`f₁ x + f₂ x ≤ μ ↔ ∃ α β, f₁ x ≤ α ∧ f₂ x ≤ β ∧ α + β = μ` valid; `⊤ + ⊥` would break it. -/
theorem theorem_19_4 {f₁ f₂ : Rn n → EReal} (h₁ : PolyhedralFn f₁) (h₂ : PolyhedralFn f₂)

  h₁.add h₂ hp₁.ne_bot hp₂.ne_bot

/-! ### The normal form `f = h + δ(· | C)` -/

/-- **§19**, the unnumbered normal form: `f` is polyhedral convex iff

`f x = h x + δ(x | C)`, with `h x = max {⟨x, b₁⟩ - β₁, …, ⟨x, bₖ⟩ - βₖ}` and
`C = {x | ⟨x, bₖ₊₁⟩ ≤ βₖ₊₁, …, ⟨x, bₘ⟩ ≤ βₘ}`.

The two families are the two kinds of closed half-space that can bound `epi f` in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`: epigraphs
of affine functions, and "vertical" ones. `∀ x, f x ≠ ⊥` cannot be dropped: since `⊥ + ⊤ = ⊥` in
`EReal`, a right-hand side of this shape takes the value `⊥` only inside `C`, whereas the function
that is `⊥` on a non-empty polyhedral `C` and `⊤` outside is convex with polyhedral epigraph. -/

/-- **Theorem 19.6** for general `m`, in convention-free form:

`cl (conv (C₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Cₘ)) = conv (C₁ ∪ ⋯ ∪ Cₘ) + (0⁺C₁ + ⋯ + 0⁺Cₘ)`.

does not, both sides collapsing to `0⁺∅` when `C = ∅`. -/

/-- **Theorem 19.7**. For `C` a non-empty polyhedral convex set, the closure of the convex cone
generated by `C` is a polyhedral convex cone. The closure is needed: for `C` the horizontal line at
height `1` in `ℝ²` the cone generated is the open upper half-plane with the origin, and the missing
horizontal directions are exactly `0⁺C`. -/
