# Rockafellar, §18: Extreme Points and Faces of Convex Sets

The facial structure of a convex set, the internal representations `C = conv S` and
`C = cl (conv S)` it produces, and the external representation dual to the second.

All sixteen numbered results of §18 are formalized over `Rn n = ℝⁿ`: Theorems 18.1–18.8 and
Corollaries 18.1.1–18.1.3, 18.3.1, 18.5.1–18.5.3, 18.7.1.

A face is the backbone's `IsFace`, Rockafellar's definition verbatim, and an extreme point is
Mathlib's `Set.extremePoints ℝ`, a zero-dimensional face. A *direction* is recorded by a generating
vector rather than by a quotient, so `extremeDirections C` is closed under positive scaling; and
`conv S`, for `S` a set of points and directions, is `convexHullPD P D`.

Several statements here are more general than the book's, or supply what it omits. `theorem_18_1`
and `theorem_18_3` drop hypotheses the book states. `theorem_18_5_lineality` is the "obvious
extension" of Theorem 18.5 to a closed convex set of arbitrary lineality, which the book states in
words and never proves, and `facesEquivFacesInterOrthogonal` is the face correspondence it asserts
"evidently" on p. 166. Corollaries 18.5.2 and 18.7.1 do not need the cone to contain more than the
origin, and Corollary 18.7.1 is printed with no proof at all.

/-- **§18 (p. 162).** A **face** of a convex set `C` is a convex subset `C'` of `C` such that every
closed line segment in `C` with a relative interior point in `C'` has both endpoints in `C'`.
Convexity of `C'` is a genuine extra requirement: `{0, 1}` is an extreme subset of `[0, 1]` but not
a face of it. -/

/-- **Theorem 18.1**. If `C'` is a face of `C` and `D ⊆ C` has a relative interior point in `C'`,
then `D ⊆ C'`. The book also assumes `D` convex; the proof uses only the prolongation lemma of §6,
which says nothing about `D` beyond `ri D`. -/

/-! ### Theorem 18.3: the faces of a hull of points and directions -/

/-- **Theorem 18.3**. If `C = conv S` for a set `S` of points and directions and `C'` is a face of
`C`, then `C' = conv S'`, where `S'` consists of the points of `S` lying in `C'` and the directions
of `S` in which `C'` recedes. The book's hypothesis that `C'` be non-empty is not needed. -/

    C' = convexHullPD (P ∩ C') {y ∈ D | y ∈ recessionCone C'} :=

    (convexHullPD P D).extremePoints ℝ ⊆ P :=

every extreme direction of `conv S` is a direction of `S` — a positive multiple of a vector of
`D`. -/

/-! ### Theorem 18.4: a closed convex set is the hull of its relative boundary -/

/-- **Theorem 18.4**. If a closed convex set `C` is neither an affine set nor a closed half of one,
every relative interior point of `C` lies on a segment joining two relative boundary points. The
book's two exceptional cases are the single predicate `IsAffineHalf`: allowing the functional to be
`0` makes "affine set" the degenerate case of "closed half of an affine set". -/

/-! ### Theorem 18.5: the fundamental internal representation -/

/-- **Theorem 18.5**. A closed convex set containing no lines is `conv S`, for `S` the set of its
extreme points and extreme directions. -/

/-- **Theorem 18.5** for a closed convex set of arbitrary lineality — the "obvious extension" of
p. 166, which the book states in words and never proves. With `L` the lineality space of `C` and
`C₀ = C ∩ L^⊥`, one has `C = L + conv S₀` for `S₀` the extreme points and extreme directions of
`C₀`; `C₀` contains no lines because the direction of such a line would lie in both `L` and
`L^⊥`. -/

/-- **Theorem 18.6** (Straszewicz's Theorem). Every extreme point of a closed convex set is the
limit of a sequence of exposed points. -/

    C.extremePoints ℝ ⊆ closure (C.exposedPoints ℝ) :=

/-- **Theorem 18.6** in the book's own phrasing: the exposed points of a closed convex set form a
dense subset of its extreme points. -/

/-! ### Exposed faces and exposed points (p. 162) -/

/-- **§18 (p. 162).** The **exposed faces** of `C` are the sets of points at which some linear
function `⟨·, b⟩` attains its maximum over `C`. The book's vector `b` and Mathlib's continuous
linear functional are the same quantification in `ℝⁿ`. -/

/-- **§18 (p. 162).** An **exposed point** of `C` is a point through which there is a supporting
hyperplane containing no other point of `C`. -/

/-! ### Theorem 18.7: the exposed representation -/

/-- **Theorem 18.7**. A closed convex set containing no lines is `cl (conv S)`, for `S` the set of
its exposed points and exposed directions. Unlike Theorem 18.5 the closure cannot be dropped: the
exposed points of a closed convex set need not form a closed set. -/
theorem theorem_18_7 (hC : Convex ℝ C) (hCcl : IsClosed C) (hnl : ContainsNoLine C) :
    closure (convexHullPD (C.exposedPoints ℝ) (exposedDirections C)) = C :=
  closure_convexHullPD_exposedPoints_exposedDirections hC hCcl hnl

/-- **Corollary 18.7.1**. If `K` is a closed convex cone containing no lines and every exposed ray
of `K` is generated by some `x ∈ T ⊆ K`, then `K` is the closure of the convex cone generated by
`T`.

**The book prints this corollary with no proof.** The argument it wants is the one given for
Corollary 18.5.2, one layer up: by Theorem 18.7, `K = cl (conv S)` for `S` the exposed points and
exposed directions of `K`; the origin is the only exposed point, being the only extreme point of a
line-free cone; and `conv` of the origin with a set of directions is the cone they generate. -/

/-! ### Theorem 18.8: the tangent representation -/

/-- **§18 (p. 168).** A hyperplane is **tangent** to a closed convex set `C` at `x` if it is the
unique supporting hyperplane to `C` at `x`; here it is `{z | ⟨z, b⟩ = ⟨x, b⟩}`, with tangent
half-space `{z | ⟨z, b⟩ ≤ ⟨x, b⟩}`. `IsTangentAt` renders "unique hyperplane" as uniqueness of the
functional up to a *positive* multiple: a hyperplane fixes its functional up to a non-zero scalar,
and the supporting inequality fixes the sign. -/
def IsTangentHyperplaneAt (C : Set (Rn n)) (b : Rn n) (x : Rn n) : Prop :=
  IsTangentAt C (linFn b) x

/-- **Theorem 18.8**. An `n`-dimensional closed convex set in `ℝⁿ` is the intersection of the
closed half-spaces tangent to it. "`n`-dimensional in `ℝⁿ`" is `(interior C).Nonempty`. -/
