# Rockafellar, §27: The Minimum of a Convex Function

The unconstrained minimum of a convex function and its duality with `f*` at the origin
(Theorem 27.1); existence, compactness and well-posedness of the minimum set under a recession
hypothesis (Theorems 27.2 and 27.3); and the optimality condition `0 ∈ ∂h(x) + N_C(x)` for
minimising over a convex set (Theorem 27.4).

All 9 numbered results of §27 are formalized: Theorems 27.1–27.4 — 27.1 with its nine clauses
(a)–(i) — and Corollaries 27.2.1, 27.2.2, 27.3.1, 27.3.2 and 27.3.3.

The book's *minimum set* of `f` is the backbone's `argmin f = {x | ∀ z, f x ≤ f z}`, whose unfolded
form is the subgradient inequality at `x* = 0`; `mem_argmin_iff_isMinOn` is the bridge to Mathlib's
`IsMinOn`. The level set `lev_α f` is written out as `{x | f x ≤ (α : EReal)}` and `inf f` is
`⨅ x, f x` in `EReal`, so "bounded below", "finite" and "attained" read as `≠ ⊥`, `≠ ⊥ ∧ ≠ ⊤` and
`(argmin f).Nonempty`. The one definition introduced here is `IsDirectionOfRecession`.

Corollaries 27.2.1 and 27.2.2 are about minimising *sequences* and are stated that way;
`corollary_27_2_1_infDist` records the backbone's arbitrary-filter form of the same fact.

theorem theorem_27_1_a (f : Rn n → EReal) : (⨅ x, f x) = -(conj (pairing n) f 0) :=
  iInf_eq_neg_conj_zero (pairing n) f

/-- **Theorem 27.1(a)**, second sentence: `f` is bounded below iff `0 ∈ dom f*`. Also
hypothesis-free. -/

/-! ### Theorem 27.1(b): the minimum set is `∂f*(0)` -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(b)**, first sentence: the minimum set of a closed convex `f` is `∂f*(0)`, by
Theorem 23.5 at the origin. Properness, which the book assumes throughout, is not needed. -/

  rw [argmin_eq_subgradient_conj_zero (B := pairing n) hf hc, subgradient_flip_pairing]

subdifferentiable at the origin. -/

    (argmin f).Nonempty ↔ (subgradient (pairing n) (conj (pairing n) f) 0).Nonempty := by

/-- **Theorem 27.1(b)**, third sentence: `0 ∈ ri (dom f*)` is enough for the infimum to be attained.
This is Theorem 23.4 for `f*` at the origin. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(b)**, last sentence: `0 ∈ ri (dom f*)` exactly when every direction of recession
of `f` is a direction in which `f` is constant. Corollary 8.6.1 is what makes `constancySpace f` the
book's phrase. -/

/-! ### Theorem 27.1(c): finite but unattained -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(c)**. The infimum of a closed proper convex `f` is finite but unattained exactly
when `f*(0)` is finite and `f*'(0; y) = -∞` for some `y`. **Only one of the book's two finiteness
bounds carries information on each side**; the two that are free are `theorem_27_1_c_free`. -/

  iInf_ne_bot_and_argmin_eq_empty_iff (B := pairing n) hf hc hp

/-- The two bounds `theorem_27_1_c` leaves out, so that the reading "finite" can be checked against
the statement: for a proper `f`, `inf f ≠ ⊤` and `f*(0) ≠ ⊥` hold unconditionally. -/

/-! ### Theorem 27.1(d): a nonempty bounded minimum set -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(d)**, first sentence: the minimum set of a closed proper convex `f` is nonempty
and bounded exactly when `0 ∈ int (dom f*)`. -/

recession. -/

/-! ### Theorem 27.1(e): a unique minimiser is `∇f*(0)` -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(e)**. The minimum set of a closed proper convex `f` is `{x}` exactly when `f*` is
differentiable at the origin with `∇f*(0) = x`. Nothing needs reflexivity: `∂f*(0)` is a subset of
`ℝⁿ`, because the pairing is what says what a dual variable of `f*` is. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(g)**, first sentence: for each real `α` the support function of `lev_α f` is the
closure of the positively homogeneous convex function generated by `f* + α`. -/

      = clFn (posHomGen fun y => conj (pairing n) f y + (α : EReal)) :=
  supportFn_setOf_le (B := pairing n) hf hc α

/-- **Theorem 27.1(g)**, second sentence: when `f` is bounded below, the support function of the
minimum set is the closure of `f*'(0; ·)`. Clause (b) plus Theorem 23.2; "bounded below" enters as
`f*(0) ≠ ⊤`, which is clause (a). -/

/-! ### Theorem 27.1(h): the limit of the support functions -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(h)**. If `inf f` is finite then `lim_{α ↓ inf f} δ*(y | lev_α f) = f*'(0; y)` for
every `y`. **The limit is stated as an infimum**: the level sets increase with `α`, so their support
functions do, and the monotone limit *is* the infimum; no filter is needed. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.1(i)**, second sentence: `0 ∉ cl (dom f*)` exactly when `f` decreases at a uniform
positive rate along some nonzero direction. `y ≠ 0` is automatic — at `y = 0` the inequality at
`λ = 1` would read `0 ≤ -ε` on `dom f` — and restricting `x` to `dom f` costs nothing. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.2**, first sentence: a closed proper convex function with no direction of recession
has a finite infimum. The backbone's proof is the lower-semicontinuous extreme value theorem on a
level set, which Theorems 8.7 and 8.4 make compact. -/

`f x ≤ inf f + δ` lies within `ε` of the minimum set. Rockafellar's nested-compactness argument is

with no direction of recession is bounded. **The book states this corollary with no proof.** The

/-- **Corollary 27.2.2** — the label is printed in mixed case in the book. If a closed proper convex
function attains its infimum at a unique `x`, every minimising sequence converges to `x`. No
recession hypothesis: a one-point minimum set is a level set, so Theorem 8.7 forces `0⁺f = {0}`. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.3**, the non-polyhedral case: a closed proper convex `h` attains its infimum over a
nonempty closed convex `C` as soon as `h` and `C` have no direction of recession in common. The
degenerate case `dom h ∩ C = ∅`, where every point of `C` minimises, is dispatched separately. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.3**, the polyhedral refinement: for polyhedral `C` it is enough that every common
direction of recession of `h` and `C` be one in which `h` is *constant*. The book proves this from
Helly's theorem (Theorem 21.5); the proof here projects `ℝⁿ` along the constancy space of `h`. -/

/-- **Theorem 27.3** in a form the book does not state but its proof gives: for a general closed
convex `C` the hypothesis weakens to "every common direction of recession is one in which `h` is
constant *and* `C` is linear". This sits strictly between the book's two clauses. -/

/-! ### Corollary 27.3.1 -/

/-- **Corollary 27.3.1**. If every direction of recession of a closed proper convex `h` is one in
which `h` is *affine*, then `h` attains its infimum relative to any polyhedral convex `C` on which
it is bounded below. The lower bound cannot be dropped: `h(ξ₁, ξ₂) = ξ₁` is affine in every
direction and its infimum over `{ξ₂ = 0}` is `-∞`. -/

separate out: a closed proper convex function whose recession cone consists of directions of
constancy attains its infimum. -/

/-! ### Corollary 27.3.2 -/

/-- **Corollary 27.3.2**. A polyhedral convex function attains its infimum relative to any
polyhedral convex set on which it is bounded below. The book derives this from Corollary 27.3.1 and
so from Helly's theorem; the proof here needs neither. -/

already excludes `-∞`, and `h ≡ +∞` is minimised everywhere. -/

section Corollary2733

variable {ι : Type*} {f₀ : Rn n → EReal} {g : ι → Rn n → EReal}

/-- **Corollary 27.3.3**, the non-polyhedral case: a closed proper convex `f₀` attains its infimum
subject to a consistent system `fᵢ x ≤ 0`, `i ∈ I`, of closed proper convex constraints, provided
`f₀` and the `fᵢ` have no direction of recession in common. The index set is arbitrary. -/

/-! #### The polyhedral refinement

The book splits the index set as `I = I₀ ⊔ (I ∖ I₀)` with `I₀` finite; two index *types* say the
same thing and keep every `DecidableEq` out of the statement. `ι₀` is the book's `I₀`. -/

/-- **Corollary 27.3.3**, the polyhedral refinement: the infimum is attained if the constraints
split into a *finite* polyhedral family `g₀` and an arbitrary family `g₁`, and the only common
directions of recession are ones in which `f₀` and all the `g₁` are constant. The book's own
reduction lands on the polyhedral case of Theorem 27.3, so Helly's theorem is not needed. -/
