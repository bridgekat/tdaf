# Rockafellar, §32: The Maximum of a Convex Function

Maximising a convex function, which behaves nothing like minimising one. The maximum principle
(Theorem 32.1) says that a relative interior maximiser forces constancy, so the maximum lives on
the relative boundary — on a face, and ultimately at an extreme point (Theorem 32.3 and its four
corollaries). Theorem 32.4 reads the same fact through subgradients: at a maximiser every
subgradient is a non-zero normal vector.

All 11 numbered results of §32 are formalized: Theorems 32.1, 32.2, 32.3 and 32.4 and Corollaries
32.1.1, 32.2.1, 32.3.1, 32.3.2, 32.3.3, 32.3.4 and 32.4.1, together with the section's two examples
and the unnumbered remarks that carry mathematical content.

## Main definitions

* `maximumSet f C` — Rockafellar's `W`, the set of points where the supremum of `f` relative to `C`
  is attained. Corollary 32.1.1 is then the set equation `W = ⋃₀ {C' | IsFace C C' ∧ C' ⊆ W}`.
* `NoUnboundedHalfLine f C` — the standing hypothesis of Theorem 32.3, quantified over genuine
  half-lines (`v ≠ 0`). `bddAboveOnRays_iff` is the bridge to the backbone's `BddAboveOnRays`,
  which folds the book's *other* standing hypothesis `C ⊆ dom f` into the same predicate by
  allowing `v = 0`; the two agree exactly when `C ⊆ dom f`, so every statement below carries
  Rockafellar's two hypotheses separately, as he writes them.
* `linearSystem a α` — the solution set of a finite system `⟨x, aᵢ⟩ ≤ αᵢ`, so that
  `corollary_32_3_4_linearSystem` can be the book's own sentence on the basis of the simplex method.
* `parabolicSet`, `parabolicFn`, `parabolicCap`, `quarticCap` — the section's two examples.

**Corollary 32.3.2's finiteness clause is false as printed.** "Then the supremum of `f` relative to
`C` is finite" fails for the improper `f ≡ −∞`, whose domain is `ℝⁿ`, so that `ri (dom f)` contains
every compact convex `C` while the supremum is `−∞`. `corollary_32_3_2` and
`corollary_32_3_2_finite` therefore carry `Proper f`; the attainment clause needs no repair.

The two examples both use `parabolicFn`, `f(ξ₁, ξ₂) = ξ₁²/ξ₂ − ξ₂` for `ξ₂ > 0`, `0` at the origin
and `+∞` elsewhere, which is convex, closed and proper because it is the support function of
`parabolicSet`. They show that `C ⊆ ri (dom f)` in Corollary 32.3.2 cannot be weakened to
`C ⊆ dom f` even for closed `f`: on `parabolicCap` the supremum is `1` and unattained, and on
`quarticCap` it is `+∞`. Both weakenings are stated and refuted in Lean, as
`corollary_32_3_2_not_attained_of_subset_dom` and `corollary_32_3_2_not_bddAbove_of_subset_dom`.

Two statements are stronger than the book's: `theorem_32_1` drops the convexity of `C`, which its
proof does not use, and `corollary_32_4_1` applies Theorem 32.4 to `S` directly instead of passing
to `conv S`.

/-! ### Theorem 32.1: the maximum principle -/

/-- **Theorem 32.1**, the maximum principle: if a convex function attains its supremum relative to
a set `C ⊆ dom f` at a point of `ri C`, it takes the same value everywhere on `C`.

Rockafellar assumes `C` convex; the proof does not use it. All that is needed is that a relative
interior point can be prolonged past itself inside `C` (Theorem 6.4), which exhibits `z` as a
proper convex combination of `x` and a further point of `C`. -/

The inclusion `⊇` is free. For `⊆`, Theorem 18.2 produces the unique face `C'` having a given

/-! ### Theorem 32.2: passing to the convex hull -/

/-- **Theorem 32.2**: the convex hull does not raise the supremum of a
convex function, `sup_{conv S} f = sup_S f`.

The sublevel set `{x | f x ≤ sup_S f}` is convex and contains `S`, so it contains `conv S`. This
is `convexHull_min`, not a Carathéodory decomposition, and it needs neither a topology nor a
dimension bound. -/

    (⨆ x ∈ convexHull ℝ S, f x) = ⨆ x ∈ S, f x :=
  hf.iSup_convexHull S

/-- **Theorem 32.2**: "the first supremum is attained only when the second (more restrictive)
supremum is attained". The *strict* sublevel set does the same job: a convex function staying
strictly below its maximum throughout `S` stays below it throughout `conv S`. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.2.1**: for a closed convex `C` that is not an affine set
or half of one, the supremum over `C` is already the supremum over the relative boundary.

Rockafellar's two exceptional cases are one predicate in the backbone, `IsAffineHalf` — the
degenerate functional `φ = 0` gives the affine sets — and the exclusion cannot be dropped: over
`[0, ∞)` the relative boundary is `{0}` while `f x = x` has supremum `⊤`. The proof is
Theorem 18.4 in hull form (`convexHull ℝ (C \ ri C) = C`) fed to Theorem 32.2. -/

  exists_notMem_relint_eq_of_isMaxOn hf hC hCcl hhalf hx hmax

/-! ### Theorem 32.3: the extreme point principle -/

/-- **Theorem 32.3**, the standing hypothesis "there are no half-lines in `C` on which `f` is
unbounded above", read over genuine half-lines (`v ≠ 0`). -/
def NoUnboundedHalfLine (f : Rn n → EReal) (C : Set (Rn n)) : Prop :=
  ∀ u v : Rn n, v ≠ 0 → (∀ t : ℝ, 0 ≤ t → u + t • v ∈ C) →
    ∃ β : ℝ, ∀ t : ℝ, 0 ≤ t → f (u + t • v) ≤ (β : EReal)

/-- **The bridge to the backbone's `BddAboveOnRays`.** The backbone folds Rockafellar's two standing
hypotheses of Theorem 32.3 into one predicate by letting the direction `v` be `0`, so that the
degenerate "half-line" `{u}` carries the condition `f u < ⊤`; under `C ⊆ dom f` the degenerate case
is automatic and the two predicates agree. -/

/-- **Theorem 32.3**, in the book's own form: `sup_C f = sup_E f`, where `E` is the set of extreme
points of `C ∩ L⊥` and `L` is the lineality space of `C`.

The backbone states this for an *arbitrary* complement `N` of `L`, since fixing `L⊥` would need an
inner product it does not assume. Here the inner product is available, so this is that theorem at
`N = L⊥` — the book's form. -/

/-- **Theorem 32.3**: "the supremum relative to `C` is attained only when the supremum relative to
`E` is attained". The maximiser is transported to `C ∩ L⊥` along the lineality space, where
Corollary 32.3.1 applies. Rockafellar's `C ⊆ dom f` is what supplies `f x ≠ ⊤` there. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.3.1**: if the supremum of a convex function over a closed convex set containing
no lines is attained at all, it is attained at an extreme point. No boundedness is needed — a finite
maximum is itself a bound — but `f x ≠ ⊤` is, and that is what `C ⊆ dom f` supplies. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.3.2**: a convex function attains its supremum relative to a non-empty closed
bounded convex `C ⊆ ri (dom f)` at an extreme point of `C`. `C ⊆ ri (dom f)` makes `f` continuous
relative to `C` (Theorem 10.1), closed and bounded makes `C` compact, and Corollary 32.3.1 moves the
maximiser to an extreme point. `Proper f` is not in the book's statement; see

needs `Proper f`, which the book omits**: for `f ≡ −∞` the printed hypotheses hold and the supremum
is `⊥`. Given properness the supremum is the value at the maximiser, a real number because the
maximiser lies in `dom f` and `f` never takes `−∞`. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.3.3**: on a non-empty polyhedral `C ⊆ dom f` with no half-line on which `f` is
unbounded above, the supremum of `f` relative to `C` is attained. Nothing is claimed about extreme
points, and nothing is assumed about lines in `C` — a set containing a line has none. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.3.4**: a convex function bounded above on a non-empty polyhedral convex set
containing no lines attains its supremum at one of the (finitely many) extreme points.

This combines Corollaries 32.3.1 and 32.3.3, and is **the theoretical basis of the simplex
method**: it "applies in particular to the problem of maximizing an affine function over the set of
solutions to a finite system of weak linear inequalities", which is
`corollary_32_3_4_linearSystem`. The uniform real bound carries Rockafellar's standing
`C ⊆ dom f` with it. -/

/-- **Theorem 32.4**: "here `f` must be proper by Theorem 7.2, since `f` is assumed to be finite at
a point of `ri (dom f)`." Properness is a *consequence* of the theorem's hypotheses, not one of
them, and this is the step that produces it. -/

/-- **Theorem 32.4**: "the set `∂f(x)` is non-empty, because `x ∈ ri (dom f)` (Theorem 23.4)" —

/-- **Theorem 32.4**: at a point where `f` attains its supremum relative to `C`, every
`x* ∈ ∂f(x)` is normal to `C` at `x`.

Rockafellar routes this through the sublevel set `D = {z | f z ≤ α}` and Theorem 23.7. Read
directly it is one line: the subgradient inequality at `z` and maximality at `z` sandwich
`⟨z − x, x*⟩` between `0` and `0`. Only finiteness of `f x` is used, so neither convexity of `C`
nor `x ∈ ri (dom f)` appears. -/

/-- **Theorem 32.4**: the vector is **non-zero**. Rockafellar's argument is that `inf f < f x`
because `f` is not constant on `C`, hence `0 ∉ ∂f(x)`; here the witness of non-constancy is passed
directly, since a set on which `f` is not constant supplies one at every one of its points. -/

/-- **Corollary 32.4.1**: for a proper convex `f` and a non-empty `S` on which `f` is not constant,
if the supremum of `f` relative to `S` is attained at `x ∈ ri (dom f)`, then every `x* ∈ ∂f(x)` is
non-zero and the *linear* function `⟨·, x*⟩` attains its supremum relative to `S` at `x`.

Rockafellar passes to `C = conv S` so that Theorem 32.4 applies to a convex set. That detour is
unnecessary: `theorem_32_4_normal` asks nothing of `C`, so it applies to `S` itself. -/

/-! #### The weakening of Corollary 32.3.2 that the two examples refute -/

/-- **§32**, first half of the remark the two examples exist for, *stated and refuted*: Corollary
32.3.2 with `C ⊆ ri (dom f)` weakened to `C ⊆ dom f` would say that the supremum is still attained.
It is not, and adding `ClosedFn` and `Proper` — the book's "even when `f` is closed" — does not save
it. The witness is `parabolicCap`. -/

still finite. The witness is `quarticCap`, on which `f` is not even bounded above. -/
