# Rockafellar, §5: Functional Operations

The operations that build new convex functions out of old: outer composition, addition, infimal
convolution `□`, pointwise suprema, the convex hull of a collection, and image and inverse image
under a linear map. All 8 numbered results of §5 are formalized.

Theorems 5.7 and 5.8 carry no letter labels in the book, so the declaration suffixes are the
book's own symbols: `gA` and `Ah` for 5.7, and the four displayed function names `f`, `g`, `h`,
`k` for 5.8. `ℝⁿ⁺¹` is `Rn n × ℝ` here, which is what "a convex set `F` in `ℝⁿ⁺¹`" means when
Theorem 5.3 goes on to write `(x, μ) ∈ F`.

## Two traps

**Properness is not preserved by `□`.** No declaration here concludes properness of an infimal
convolute, and `exists_not_proper_infimalConvolution` is the witness: `f x = ⟨v, x⟩` and
`g x = -⟨v, x⟩` are proper convex with `f □ g ≡ -∞`. That is also why the backbone defines `□` by
adding epigraphs rather than by the infimum formula, which would be `∞ - ∞`;
`infimalConvolution_apply` recovers the formula under properness.

**`f0` is defined by cases**, as in the book: `rightSMul_zero` gives `f0 = δ(· | 0)` when
`f ≢ +∞`, and `rightSMul_zero_of_top` gives `f0 = f` when `f ≡ +∞`. `hom_apply_smul` is where
that case split meets §4's `0 · ∞ = 0`, and the two agree.

/-! ### Infimal convolution

Rockafellar, §5, after Theorem 5.4: "The function `f` in Theorem 5.4 will be denoted by
`f₁ □ f₂ □ ⋯ □ fₘ`. The operation `□` is called infimal convolution." -/

/-- **Theorem 5.4**, binary case: `f □ g` is convex whenever `f` and `g` are. No properness is
needed, the epigraph definition `f □ g = ofEpi (epi f + epi g)` being Theorem 5.3 applied to a sum
of convex sets; the book's properness is what makes the *infimum formula* meaningful. -/
theorem convexFn_infimalConvolution {n : ℕ} {f g : Rn n → EReal} (hf : ConvexFn f)

/-- For two functions, `(f □ g) x = infᵧ {f (x - y) + g y}` — the analogue of the classical
formula for integral convolution. Properness is what makes the right-hand side unambiguous; `□`
is *defined* through epigraph addition, as in the book, because this infimum produces the
forbidden `∞ - ∞` when one function reaches `-∞`. -/

the graph of `f` horizontally by `a`." -/

    (f □ indicatorFn ({a} : Set (Rn n))) = fun x => f (x - a) :=

/-- Infimal convolution is commutative and associative on all functions `ℝⁿ → [-∞, +∞]`, with
`δ(· | 0)` as identity: the monoid structure lives on the type synonym `InfConvFn (Rn n)`. -/

/-- **Properness is not preserved by `□`.** For `v ≠ 0` the pair `f x = ⟨v, x⟩`, `g x = -⟨v, x⟩`
is finite, hence proper, and convex, while `(f □ g) x = -∞` everywhere. This is why no result of
§5 concludes properness of an infimal convolute. -/

/-! ### Left and right scalar multiplication

Rockafellar, §5: `(λf) x = λ (f x)` for `λ ≥ 0`, and `fλ` is the function obtained from
Theorem 5.3 with `F = λ (epi f)`. -/

/-- Non-negative left scalar multiplication `(λ f) x = λ (f x)` preserves convexity. `EReal`
obeys the book's `0 · ∞ = 0`, so `λ = 0` is not a special case. -/

    ConvexFn fun x => (l : EReal) * f x :=

applied to the convex set `λ (epi f)`. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, §5**, third branch: "trivially `f0 = f` if `f ≡ +∞`".

/-! ### The positively homogeneous convex function generated by `h` -/

/-- The **positively homogeneous convex function generated by `h`**: the greatest positively
homogeneous convex `f` with `f 0 ≤ 0` and `f ≤ h`, obtained by applying Theorem 5.3 to the convex
cone in `ℝⁿ⁺¹` generated by `epi h`. Not the backbone's `hom`, which is the same construction
applied to the level-one lift of `h` and so lives one dimension up. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, §5**, the illustration after Theorem 5.5: the function assigning to
`x = (ξ₁, …, ξₙ)` the greatest of its components is convex, "because it is the pointwise supremum
of the linear functions `⟨x, eⱼ⟩`". (It is also the support function of the unit simplex.) -/

/-! ### The convex hull of a function, and of a collection

`conv g` is Theorem 5.3 applied to `F = conv (epi g)`, and `conv {fᵢ}` the same with the convex
hull of the union of the epigraphs. -/

/-- **Rockafellar, §5.** `conv {fᵢ | i ∈ I}` "is the greatest convex function `f` (not necessarily
proper) on `ℝⁿ` such that `f x ≤ fᵢ x` for every `x ∈ ℝⁿ` and every `i ∈ I`".

/-! ### Theorem 5.6 -/

/-- **Theorem 5.6.** The convex hull of a collection of proper convex functions is
`f x = inf {∑ᵢ λᵢ fᵢ xᵢ | ∑ᵢ λᵢ xᵢ = x}`, over all representations of `x` as a convex combination
with finitely many non-zero coefficients (carried by the `Finset`). The function-level analogue of
Theorem 2.3. -/

/-- The convex functions on `ℝⁿ`, ordered pointwise, form a **complete lattice** with greatest
lower bound `conv {fᵢ}` and least upper bound `sup {fᵢ}`. The lattice is `ConvexFns (Rn n)`, and
`ConvexFns.not_coe_inf_eq_inf` is the warning behind the book's "(relative to this particular
partially ordered set!)": the meet is not the pointwise infimum. -/

/-- **Theorem 5.7**, first assertion. The *inverse image* `(gA) x = g (A x)` of a convex function
under a linear transformation is convex. -/

function is convex. The infimum need not be attained, which is why `Ah` is not read off the image
of `epi h` as a set. -/

/-! ### Theorem 5.8

The book derives the four operations below from partial additions of convex cones in `ℝⁿ⁺²`. The
statements are four explicit formulas, and each is an instance of Theorem 5.7 applied to a jointly
convex function of the auxiliary variables, so nothing here depends on that construction. -/
