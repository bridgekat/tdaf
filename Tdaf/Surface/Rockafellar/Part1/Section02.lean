# Rockafellar, §2: Convex Sets and Cones

The surface transcription of §2 of R. T. Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis* (Princeton, 1970),
pp. 10–15. All thirteen numbered results are here. The section is thin: eight of the thirteen are
one-line specialisations of Mathlib's `Convex`/`convexHull` API, and Theorem 2.6 is the backbone's
`convex_iff_add_mem_of_isCone` verbatim.

## Main definitions

* `Rockafellar.IsCone` — the book's *cone*: closed under **positive** scalar multiplication, with
  the origin free to belong or not (book, line 737). This is deliberately **not** Mathlib's
  `PointedCone`, which contains `0` by definition, and the difference is not cosmetic: the cones
  produced by Corollaries 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 need not contain the origin, while `cone S` (book,
  line 745) is defined by adjoining it. `isCone_iff_smul_set_eq` is the bridge to the backbone's
  spelling `∀ a > 0, a • s = s`, which is the hypothesis of `smul_mem_iff_of_isCone` and
  `convex_iff_add_mem_of_isCone`; `toPointedCone` is the bridge to Mathlib for the case
  `0 ∈ K`, which is the hypothesis of Theorem 2.7.
* `Rockafellar.posCombinations` — the *positive linear combinations* of a set, the object of
  Corollaries 2.6.1 and 2.6.2.

The *dimension* of a convex set is `Rockafellar.dim` from §1: `dim C` is the dimension of the
subspace parallel to `aff C`, which is what the book says (book, line 691).

## Main results

* `theorem_2_1`, `corollary_2_1_1` — arbitrary intersections of convex sets, and solution sets of
  systems of weak linear inequalities, are convex.
* `theorem_2_2`, `theorem_2_3`, `corollary_2_3_1` — convexity is closure under convex
  combinations; `conv S` is the set of convex combinations of `S`; the finite case.
* `theorem_2_4` — `dim C` is the largest dimension of a simplex included in `C`.
* `theorem_2_5`, `corollary_2_5_1` — the same as 2.1 and 2.1.1 for convex cones and homogeneous
  systems.
* `theorem_2_6` — a set is a convex cone iff it is closed under addition and positive scaling.
* `corollary_2_6_1`, `corollary_2_6_2`, `corollary_2_6_3` — positive linear combinations, and the
  smallest convex cone including a set, or a convex set.
* `theorem_2_7_least`, `theorem_2_7_sub`, `theorem_2_7_aff`, `theorem_2_7_greatest` — for a convex
  cone `K` containing `0`, the smallest subspace containing `K` is `K - K = aff K`, and the
  largest subspace inside `K` is `(-K) ∩ K`.

## Modelling notes

**Theorem 2.4 needs `C` non-empty**, which the book does not say. For `C = ∅` there is no simplex
included in `C` at all, so the set of dimensions of such simplices is empty and has no maximum,
while `dim ∅ = -1`. A *simplex* is transcribed as `convexHull ℝ b` for an affinely independent
`b : Set (Rn n)`; such a `b` is automatically finite in `ℝⁿ`, of at most `n + 1` points, so no
finiteness hypothesis is carried.

**Theorem 2.7 is split into four declarations** because the book's single sentence asserts four
things: that a smallest subspace containing `K` exists, that it is `K - K`, that it is `aff K`,
and that a largest subspace inside `K` exists and is `(-K) ∩ K`. Only the first is formal
nonsense (`Submodule.span` and its Galois connection); the other three carry the content.

## What is not here

Everything below is *deferred by scope*: it is unnumbered material of §2 whose formal counterpart
already exists in the backbone or in Mathlib, and which no numbered result of §§1–2 is stated in
terms of.

* **`cone S` and `ray S`** (book, lines 745–750). `cone S` is `PointedCone.hull ℝ S`, and the
  book's identity `cone S = conv (ray S)` is the backbone's `coe_hull_convexHull` together with
  `coe_hull_of_convex` (`Tdaf/Analysis/Convex/Recession/ConeHull.lean`). The off-by-the-origin
  between `cone S` and Corollary 2.6.2's cone is recorded in the docstring of `IsCone` rather
  than in a second definition here.
* **Polyhedral convex sets** (book, line 623) — the definition is stated in passing and the
  theory is §19; the backbone has it as `Tdaf/Analysis/Convex/Polyhedral/Defs.lean`.
* **The normal cone and the barrier cone** (book, lines 765–770) — introduced as examples of
  convex cones, with the verification left to the reader. They are `Optimization/Normal.lean` and
  `Duality/Barrier.lean` in the backbone, where §§14 and 23 need them.
* **The cross-section representation** of a convex set as a slice of a convex cone one dimension
  up (book, lines 752–758) — the backbone's `coe_hull_prodMk_one` in `Recession/ConeHull.lean`,
  which §8's Theorem 8.2 is read off.
* **Half-spaces, polytopes, simplices, orthants and the componentwise order** are definitions, not
  results. Half-spaces enter Corollaries 2.1.1 and 2.5.1 through Mathlib's `convex_halfSpace_le`;
  simplices enter Theorem 2.4 through `AffineIndependent` and `convexHull`.

A *simplex* is the convex hull of an affinely independent set; in `ℝⁿ` such a set is automatically
finite, of at most `n + 1` points (`AffineIndependent.card_le_finrank_succ`), so no finiteness
hypothesis is carried. The book states the result for a non-empty `C`: for `C = ∅` there are no
simplices at all, and a maximum over the empty set does not exist. -/
