# Rockafellar, §24: Differential Continuity and Monotonicity

The continuity and monotonicity properties of `∂f`, first on the line and then on `ℝⁿ`, ending with
the characterisation of the subdifferentials as the maximal cyclically monotone mappings.

All eleven numbered results of §24 are formalized: Theorems 24.1–24.9 and Corollaries 24.2.1,
24.5.1.

**Two ambient spaces.** Theorems 24.1–24.3 are about a closed proper convex function on `R`, and
are stated here over `ℝ` itself rather than over `Rn 1`: that is the book's own reading, since a
one-sided derivative, a non-decreasing function and a subset of `R²` are real-analytic objects
rather than coordinate ones. The pairing on the line is `innerₗ ℝ`, which is multiplication.
Theorems 24.4–24.9 are over `Rn n` with `pairing n`.

`f'₊` and `f'₋` are the backbone's `rightDeriv` and `leftDeriv`, whose definitions already carry
Rockafellar's extension by `+∞` to the right of `dom f` and `-∞` to the left, so nothing here
case-splits on the position of `x`. Where `f` is finite the guard is inert, and `f'₊(x) = f'(x; 1)`,
`f'₋(x) = -f'(x; -1)`.

The book gives two descriptions of a **complete non-decreasing curve** in `R²`: as
`Γ = {(x, x*) | φ₋(x) ≤ x* ≤ φ₊(x)}` for a non-decreasing `φ` not everywhere infinite, and as a
maximal totally ordered subset of `R²` for the coordinatewise ordering. The second is taken here as
`IsCompleteNonDecreasingCurve`, Mathlib's `IsMaxChain (· ≤ ·)` on `ℝ × ℝ`; the first is the
backbone's `monotoneCurve`, and `isCompleteNonDecreasingCurve_iff_exists_monotone` is the
equivalence, which the book asserts without proof.

**Maximal cyclic monotonicity is not maximal monotonicity.** Rockafellar warns explicitly that
Corollary 31.5.2 does *not* follow from Theorem 24.9 together with "cyclically monotone implies
monotone", since a mapping maximal in the smaller class need not be maximal in the larger. So
`theorem_24_9` is about maximal *cyclic* monotonicity only, `isMonotoneRel_subgradientRel_rn` about
plain monotonicity, and nothing here bridges them. On the line the two classes do coincide
(`isMonotoneRel_iff_isCyclicallyMonotone_line`), which is why Theorem 24.3 can speak of maximal
chains at all.

`+∞` on `(-∞, 0)`, `f'₊` is `-∞` at `0` and `0` to the right of it. -/

non-decreasing `φ` finite at `a` there is a closed proper convex `f` on `R` with `f'₋ = φ₋` and
`f'₊ = φ₊`, where `φ₋(x) = lim_{z ↑ x} φ(z)` and `φ₊(x) = lim_{z ↓ x} φ(z)`. The book exhibits `f`
as `∫ₐˣ φ(t) dt`; here it is built from the graph `Γ(φ)`, a maximal monotone relation. -/

/-- **Corollary 24.2.1**, right-derivative half: on the interior of its effective domain a proper
convex function on `R` is the integral of `f'₊`,

```
f(y) - f(x) = ∫ₓʸ f'₊(t) dt.
```

The integrand is the derivative of a function already convex and finite on an open interval, so
this is the fundamental theorem of calculus and needs no theory of monotone functions. -/

/-- **Corollary 24.2.1**, left-derivative half: `f(y) - f(x) = ∫ₓʸ f'₋(t) dt`. The two one-sided

/-- **§24.** A **complete non-decreasing curve** in `R²` is a maximal totally ordered subset for
the coordinatewise partial ordering — a maximal chain. The book introduces the notion by the
formula `Γ = {(x, x*) | φ₋(x) ≤ x* ≤ φ₊(x)}` and then records this description as equivalent. -/

  IsMaxChain (· ≤ ·) Γ

/-- **The bridge to the backbone**: a maximal chain of `ℝ × ℝ` is exactly a maximal monotone
relation on the line. Monotonicity of a relation on `R` *is* total ordering of its graph, the only
difference being that `IsChain` excuses the diagonal, which `le_refl` supplies. -/

/-- **§24**, the book's defining formula implies the order-theoretic description: the region between
the two one-sided limits of a non-decreasing `φ` that is finite somewhere is a complete
non-decreasing curve. Maximality of `Γ(φ)` is what produces the primitive in Theorem 24.2. -/

/-- **§24**, the converse: every complete non-decreasing curve is the region between the two
one-sided limits of a non-decreasing `φ` that is finite somewhere. Theorem 24.3 turns the maximal
chain into a subdifferential, which is the curve of the right derivative with its value at one
relative interior point of the domain replaced by a subgradient there. -/

`Γ* = {(x*, x) | (x, x*) ∈ Γ}`. The book proves it by conjugacy, `Γ* = graph ∂f*`;

derivative `f'(x; y; z) = dirDeriv (dirDeriv f x) y z` eventually bounds `f'(xᵢ; z)`. Rockafellar
assumes `f` closed; that is not needed here, because the vanishing step `|xᵢ - x|` is replaced by a
fixed larger one, so only continuity of `f` at interior points is used. -/

`S ⊆ int (dom f)`, bounds the directional derivatives there, and is a Lipschitz constant for `f` on
`S`. The book takes `α = sup {|x*| : x* ∈ ∂f(S)}`; what is asserted here is the existence of *some*
such `α`, which is implied by, but weaker than, the book's sharper reading. -/

/-! ### Theorems 24.8 and 24.9: cyclic monotonicity -/

section Cyclic

variable {n : ℕ} {ρ : SetRel (Rn n) (Rn n)} {f : Rn n → EReal}

/-- A closed proper convex function on `Rⁿ` exists: the zero function. This is what makes Theorem
24.8 true for the empty mapping, which Rockafellar's proof sets aside. -/
private theorem closedProperConvexFn_zero (n : ℕ) :
    ClosedProperConvexFn (affineFn (pairing n) 0 0) :=
  ⟨convexFn_affineFn 0 0, closedFn_affineFn (continuous_pairing (pairing n) 0),
    proper_affineFn 0 0⟩

/-- **Theorem 24.8**, sufficiency: a cyclically monotone multivalued mapping from `Rⁿ` to `Rⁿ` is
contained in the subdifferential of a closed proper convex function. The empty mapping is included,
which Rockafellar's own proof excludes by fiat. -/
theorem theorem_24_8_of_isCyclicallyMonotone (hρ : IsCyclicallyMonotone (pairing n) ρ) :
    ∃ f : Rn n → EReal, ClosedProperConvexFn f ∧ ρ ⊆ subgradientRel (pairing n) f := by

    exists_convexFn_subgradientRel_of_isCyclicallyMonotone hρ hne
  exact ⟨g, ⟨hconv, hclosed, hproper⟩, hsub⟩

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 24.8**: a multivalued mapping from `Rⁿ` to `Rⁿ` is contained in the
subdifferential of a closed proper convex function if and only if it is cyclically monotone. -/
theorem theorem_24_8 :
    (∃ f : Rn n → EReal, ClosedProperConvexFn f ∧ ρ ⊆ subgradientRel (pairing n) f) ↔
      IsCyclicallyMonotone (pairing n) ρ :=
  ⟨fun ⟨_, hf, hsub⟩ => (isCyclicallyMonotone_subgradientRel hf.proper).mono hsub,
    theorem_24_8_of_isCyclicallyMonotone⟩

/-- **Theorem 24.9**, one half: the subdifferential of a closed proper convex function is a maximal
cyclically monotone mapping — **not** a statement about maximal *monotonicity*. -/
theorem theorem_24_9_subgradientRel (hf : ClosedProperConvexFn f) :
    IsMaximalCyclicallyMonotone (pairing n) (subgradientRel (pairing n) f) :=
  isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone_subgradientRel hf

/-- **Rockafellar, Theorem 24.9**: the subdifferential mappings of the closed proper convex
functions on `Rⁿ` are exactly the maximal cyclically monotone mappings from `Rⁿ` to `Rⁿ`. -/
theorem theorem_24_9 :
    IsMaximalCyclicallyMonotone (pairing n) ρ ↔
      ∃ f : Rn n → EReal, ClosedProperConvexFn f ∧ ρ = subgradientRel (pairing n) f :=
  isMaximalCyclicallyMonotone_iff_exists_closedProperConvexFn

/-- **Theorem 24.9**, second clause: the function is determined by its subdifferential mapping up
to an additive constant. The backbone assumes only the inclusion `∂f ⊆ ∂g`. -/
theorem theorem_24_9_unique {g : Rn n → EReal} (hf : ClosedProperConvexFn f)

    ∃ α : ℝ, ∀ x, g x = f x + (α : EReal) :=
  eq_add_coe_of_subgradientRel_subset hf hg h.subset

/-- **§24**: `∂f` is a monotone mapping, the case `m = 1` of cyclic monotonicity. Kept deliberately
separate from `theorem_24_9`: maximal monotonicity of `∂f`, Corollary 31.5.2, does **not** follow
from Theorem 24.9 together with "cyclically monotone implies monotone". -/
theorem isMonotoneRel_subgradientRel_rn (hp : Proper f) :
    IsMonotoneRel (pairing n) (subgradientRel (pairing n) f) :=
  isMonotoneRel_subgradientRel hp

/-- **§24**: when `n = 1` the monotone and the cyclically monotone mappings are the same. The book
derives this from Theorems 24.3 and 24.9; the proof here rotates a cycle so that the pair
maximising `x + x*` comes first and deletes it. For `n > 1` it is false: a linear `ρ` with matrix
`Q` is monotone as soon as the symmetric part of `Q` is positive semi-definite, and cyclically
monotone only if `Q` itself is symmetric. -/
theorem isMonotoneRel_iff_isCyclicallyMonotone_line {σ : SetRel ℝ ℝ} :
    IsMonotoneRel (innerₗ ℝ) σ ↔ IsCyclicallyMonotone (innerₗ ℝ) σ :=
