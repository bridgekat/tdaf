# Rockafellar, §25: Differentiability of Convex Functions

The relation between the subdifferential `∂f` and the ordinary gradient `∇f`. Theorem 25.1
identifies the two where `∇f` exists, Theorems 25.3–25.5 say that is almost everywhere on
`int (dom f)`, Theorem 25.6 reconstructs the whole of `∂f` from `∇f`, and Theorem 25.7 says that
gradients of convex functions converge whenever the functions do.

All eleven numbered results of §25 are formalized: Theorems 25.1–25.7 and Corollaries 25.1.1,
25.1.2, 25.1.3, 25.5.1. Theorem 25.3 is stated over `ℝ` rather than `Rn 1`, the book's `I` being an
open interval of the real line; the rest is over `Rn n` with `pairing n`.

Rockafellar's `∇f(x)` is a *vector*, while the backbone's gradient is a continuous linear
functional. `HasGradientVecAt f b x` and `gradientVec f x` are the vector readings, translated by
`linFn`, which is the Fréchet–Riesz map. Differentiability of an extended-real-valued `f` is
`DifferentiableAtFn`: a real-valued function agreeing with `f` near `x` and differentiable there,
which is exactly what `∇f(x)` presupposes. `differentiableAtFn_iff_differentiableAt` is the
dictionary to Mathlib's `DifferentiableAt` of the real trace.

Not all of §25 is finite-dimensional. Theorem 25.1's forward half, both halves of Corollary 25.1.1,
Theorem 25.2's necessity and Theorem 25.4's density clause hold over any normed space. What
genuinely needs `ℝⁿ` is Theorem 25.1's converse, which runs through Corollary 11.6.1, together with
the continuity and measure-zero clauses of Theorems 25.4 and 25.5.

/-- **Theorem 25.1**, forward half. For a convex `f` finite at `x` and differentiable there,
`∇f(x)` is the *unique* subgradient of `f` at `x`. Nothing in the argument is finite-dimensional,
and the uniqueness half uses neither convexity nor properness. -/

the forward half it holds over any normed space. -/

/-- **Theorem 25.1**, converse half, and **this one is genuinely finite-dimensional**. If a proper
convex `f` has a unique subgradient at `x` then `f` is differentiable at `x`. In finite dimensions
a convex set is a neighbourhood of every point whose normal cone is trivial (Corollary 11.6.1),
which is the step Rockafellar passes over. -/

differentiability, only that `f` is finite near `x`, which the definition of `∇f(x)` presupposes. -/

points `(x*, f*(x*))` such that `f` is differentiable at some `x` with `∇f(x) = x*`. **`f` need not
be closed**, as in the book, which replaces `f` by `cl f` on the strength of its unproved remark
`∇(cl f) = ∇f`; that remark needs `int (dom (cl f)) = int (dom f)` as well as `cl f = f` on the
interior, and both halves are in the backbone. -/

proper convex function with `C = {z | ⟨y, z⟩ ≤ g(y) for all y}`. Then `z` is an exposed point of `C`
iff `g` is differentiable at some `y` with `∇g(y) = z`. Non-emptiness and closedness of

/-! ### Theorem 25.2 -/

section Theorem252

variable {f : Rn n → EReal} {b x : Rn n}

/-- **Theorem 25.2**, necessity: at a point of differentiability the directional derivative is the
linear function `y ↦ ⟨∇f(x), y⟩`. General, like Theorem 25.1's forward half. -/
theorem theorem_25_2_dirDeriv (hf : ConvexFn f) (h : HasGradientVecAt f b x) (v : Rn n) :

  have hd := HasGradientAt.dirDeriv_eq hf (hasGradientVecAt_iff_hasGradientAt.1 h) v
  rwa [linFn_apply] at hd

/-- **Theorem 25.2**: for a convex `f` finite at `x`, differentiability at `x` is equivalent to
linearity of `f'(x; ·)`. Sufficiency is where `ℝⁿ` is used, through a cross-polytope estimate that
consumes only the `2n` one-sided derivatives along `± bⱼ`. -/

/-! ### Theorem 25.3, on the line

Rockafellar's `I` is an open interval of `ℝ` on which `f` is finite; it is `interior (dom f)` here.
His `f'` is defined on `D` only, while `rightDeriv f` is defined everywhere and agrees with `f'` on
`D`, so the clauses below are the book's, strengthened. -/

section Theorem253

variable {f : ℝ → EReal}

/-- **Theorem 25.3**, the definition of `D`: on the line, differentiability at an interior point of
`dom f` is exactly equality of the two one-sided derivatives. -/

    (hx : x ∈ interior (dom f)) : DifferentiableAtFn f x ↔ leftDeriv f x = rightDeriv f x :=
  differentiableAtFn_iff_leftDeriv_eq_rightDeriv hf hp hx

/-- **Theorem 25.3**, first assertion: `D` contains all but countably many points of `I`. -/
theorem theorem_25_3_countable (hf : ConvexFn f) (hp : Proper f) :
    {x ∈ interior (dom f) | ¬DifferentiableAtFn f x}.Countable :=
  countable_not_differentiableAtFn hf hp

    interior (dom f) ⊆ closure {z : ℝ | DifferentiableAtFn f z} :=
  subset_closure_differentiableAtFn hf hp

/-- **Theorem 25.3**, second assertion: `f'` is continuous relative to `D` — here in the stronger
form that `rightDeriv f` is continuous at each point of `D` in the ordinary sense. This is the
clause that wants the book's extension of `f` to a closed proper convex function on the line. -/

    (hx : x ∈ interior (dom f)) (hd : DifferentiableAtFn f x) : ContinuousAt (rightDeriv f) x :=

/-- **Theorem 25.3**, third assertion: `f'` is non-decreasing relative to `D`. Again stronger:
`rightDeriv f` is monotone on the whole line. -/

  monotone_rightDeriv hf hp

end Theorem253

/-! ### Theorem 25.4 -/

section Theorem254

variable {f : Rn n → EReal} {x : Rn n}

/-- **Theorem 25.4**, first assertion: for proper convex `f` and fixed `y`, the two-sided
directional derivative exists at a point of `int (dom f)` exactly where `x ↦ f'(x; y)` is
continuous. Rockafellar's `y ≠ 0` is not needed — at `y = 0` both sides hold. -/
theorem theorem_25_4_continuousAt_iff (hf : ConvexFn f) (hp : Proper f)
    (hx : x ∈ interior (dom f)) (y : Rn n) :
    ContinuousAt (fun z => dirDeriv f z y) x ↔ dirDeriv f x y = -dirDeriv f x (-y) :=
  continuousAt_dirDeriv_iff hf hp hx y

/-- **Theorem 25.4**, density — **and this clause is general**: restricting `f` to the line through
`x` in the direction `y` turns it into Theorem 25.3. -/
theorem theorem_25_4_dense (hf : ConvexFn f) (hp : Proper f) (y : Rn n) :
    interior (dom f) ⊆
      closure {z ∈ interior (dom f) | dirDeriv f z y = -dirDeriv f z (-y)} :=
  subset_closure_twoSided_dirDeriv hf hp y

/-- **Theorem 25.4**, the measure-zero clause. The implication runs the other way here: Rockafellar
proves this first, by a Fubini argument over lines, and deduces Theorem 25.5; with Rademacher's
theorem available, Theorem 25.5 comes first and this is its consequence. -/
theorem theorem_25_4_measure (hf : ConvexFn f) (hp : Proper f) (y : Rn n) :
    volume (interior (dom f) \ {z | dirDeriv f z y = -dirDeriv f z (-y)}) = 0 :=

end Theorem254

/-! ### Theorem 25.5 and its corollary -/

is dense in `int (dom f)`. -/

    interior (dom f) ⊆ closure {z : Rn n | DifferentiableAtFn f z} :=
  interior_dom_subset_closure_differentiableAtFn hf hp

/-- **Theorem 25.5**, measure zero: the complement of `D` in `int (dom f)` is null. This is
Rademacher's theorem; convexity contributes only the local Lipschitz constants. -/

    volume (interior (dom f) \ {z : Rn n | DifferentiableAtFn f z}) = 0 :=
  measure_diff_differentiableAtFn hf hp

/-- **Theorem 25.5**, continuity: `x ↦ ∇f(x)` is continuous on `D`. This is Corollary 24.5.1 with
both subdifferentials collapsed to singletons by Theorem 25.1. -/

  (InnerProductSpace.toDual ℝ (Rn n)).symm.continuous.comp_continuousOn
    (continuousOn_fderiv_toReal hf hp)

/-- **Corollary 25.5.1**: a finite convex function differentiable on an open convex set `C` is
*continuously* differentiable on `C`. **The book states this with no proof at all.** The proof here
extends `g` by `+∞` off `C` and applies Theorem 25.5's continuity clause. -/

where `K(x)` is the normal cone to `dom f` at `x` and `S(x)` is `gradientLimits f x`. The book
declares `K(x)` empty off `dom f`, whereas `normalCone` is total; the two readings agree wherever
both sides are non-empty, and off `dom f` the left side is empty, forcing `cl (conv S(x))` to be
empty too. -/

with `fᵢ → g` pointwise on `C`, one has `∇fᵢ(x) → ∇g(x)` for every `x ∈ C`. For arbitrary
