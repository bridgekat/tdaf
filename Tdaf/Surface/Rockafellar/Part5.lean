# Rockafellar, Part V: Differential Theory

R. T. Rockafellar, *Convex Analysis* (Princeton, 1970), §§23–26. This module imports the four
section modules and adds nothing of its own.

| § | module | subject |
|---|---|---|
| 23 | `Part5.Section23` | Directional Derivatives and Subgradients |
| 24 | `Part5.Section24` | Differential Continuity and Monotonicity |
| 25 | `Part5.Section25` | Differentiability of Convex Functions |
| 26 | `Part5.Section26` | The Legendre Transformation |

All 49 of Part V's numbered results are formalized. Theorems 24.1–24.3 are stated over `ℝ` itself
rather than over `Rn 1`, which is the book's own reading of them; everything else in the Part is
over `Rn n` with `pairing n`.
