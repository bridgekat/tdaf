# Rockafellar, §26: The Legendre Transformation

The classical Legendre transformation, and the exact sense in which it is the conjugacy
correspondence restricted to the functions whose subdifferential is a genuine one-to-one mapping.

All eleven numbered results of §26 are formalized over `Rn n = ℝⁿ`: Theorems 26.1, 26.3, 26.4,
26.5, 26.6, Lemmas 26.2 and 26.7, and Corollaries 26.3.1, 26.3.2, 26.3.3, 26.4.1, together with all
three of the section's counterexamples, transcribed as Lean definitions.

`SingleValued`, `inverseMap` and `OneToOne` are the book's vocabulary for multivalued mappings
(p. 251), and `legendreDomain f` is Rockafellar's `D`, the image of `C = int (dom f)` under the
gradient mapping. `LegendreType` is the backbone's, and says exactly what the book's "the pair
`(C, f)` is a convex function of Legendre type" says for `C = int (dom f)`. Essential smoothness is
carried in two equivalent forms — `EssentiallySmoothBook`, with the book's condition (c), and
`EssentiallySmoothDir`, with its directional form (c′), the equivalence being Lemma 26.2 — because
a limit-of-gradients argument produces (c) while a user with a concrete `f` can check (c′). The
backbone's `EssentiallySmooth` quantifies (c) over points *outside* `C` rather than over boundary
points of `C`; the two agree, and `essentiallySmooth_iff_book` proves it.

Three of the book's hypotheses are stronger than its own proofs need. **Theorem 26.5 says "closed
convex function" where its proof needs "closed *proper* convex"**, so `theorem_26_5` carries
`Proper f`; nothing is lost, since an improper closed convex function is `+∞` everywhere or `−∞` on
`cl (dom f)` and so is differentiable on no non-empty interior. **Theorem 26.4's single-valuedness
and its formula `g = f*` follow from convexity alone**, so `theorem_26_4_wellDefined` and
`theorem_26_4_eq` carry only `ConvexFn f`. **Corollary 26.3.3's "`A` maps `ℝⁿ` onto `ℝᵐ`" is used
only through injectivity of `A*`** — the book's own proof says so parenthetically.

There is deliberately **no involution lemma** for the Legendre transformation. The book is explicit
(p. 258) that the Legendre conjugate of the Legendre conjugate need not be the original function;
Theorem 26.5 says exactly when it is, and `not_convex_legendreDomain_halfPlaneFn` is why its
hypothesis cannot be dropped.

/-! ### Essential smoothness

A proper convex function `f` is **essentially smooth** (p. 251) when, for `C = int (dom f)`:

* (a) `C` is not empty;
* (b) `f` is differentiable throughout `C`;
* (c) `|∇f xᵢ| → +∞` whenever `x₁, x₂, …` is a sequence in `C` converging to a boundary point of
  `C`. -/

/-- **The book's condition (c) and the backbone's are the same condition.** `C = int (dom f)` is
open, so its frontier is `cl C \ C`: a boundary point of `C` is not in `C`, and conversely a point
outside `C` that a sequence in `C` converges to lies on the boundary. -/

/-! ### Essential strict convexity

A real-valued function is **strictly convex on `C`** (p. 253) when the convexity inequality between
two different points of `C` is strict, and a proper convex function on `ℝⁿ` is **essentially
strictly convex** when it is strictly convex on every convex subset of `dom ∂f`. Both are the
backbone's `StrictConvexOnFn` and `EssentiallyStrictlyConvex`, whose definitions are literally the
book's. Rockafellar's two warnings about the definition are the counterexamples below. -/

/-! ### The counterexample of p. 253

Rockafellar's first warning: a closed proper convex function which is essentially strictly convex
need **not** be strictly convex on the whole of `dom f`. -/

/-- **§26 (p. 253)**, the first counterexample:

```
f(ξ₁, ξ₂) = ξ₂²/2ξ₁ − 2ξ₂^(1/2)   if ξ₁ > 0, ξ₂ ≥ 0
          = 0                      if ξ₁ = 0 = ξ₂
          = +∞                     otherwise.
```

The two branches are one formula: at the origin the real expression reads `0/0 − 2√0`, which is `0`
in Lean, matching the book's second clause. Rockafellar's claim is that this `f` is essentially
strictly convex — indeed essentially smooth — while **not** being strictly convex on `dom f`,
because it vanishes along the whole non-negative `ξ₁`-axis. Only the second half is formalized, as
`essStrictlyConvexFn_not_strictConvexOn_dom`. -/

/-! ### The counterexample of p. 254

Rockafellar's second warning: a closed proper convex function may be strictly convex on
`ri (dom f)` and still fail to be essentially strictly convex, because `dom ∂f` can be strictly
larger than `ri (dom f)` and can contain a convex set on which `f` is constant. -/

/-- **§26 (p. 254)**, the second counterexample:

```
f(ξ₁, ξ₂) = ξ₂²/2ξ₁ + ξ₂²   if ξ₁ > 0, ξ₂ ≥ 0
          = 0                if ξ₁ = 0 = ξ₂
          = +∞               otherwise.
```

Encoded exactly as `essStrictlyConvexFn` is. Rockafellar's claim is that `ri (dom f)` is the open
positive quadrant, on which `f` *is* strictly convex, while `dom ∂f` also contains the whole
non-negative `ξ₁`-axis, on which `f` is constant — so `f` is **not** essentially strictly convex.
Both halves are proved below. -/

/-! ### The p. 254 example is strictly convex on `ri (dom f)`

The other half of Rockafellar's claim, and what makes the example separate the two conditions.
`ri (dom f)` is the open positive quadrant, and strict convexity there is the weighted
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality `(au + bv)²/(as + bt) ≤ au²/s + bv²/t` together with
`(au + bv)² ≤ au² + bv²`, one of which is strict at any two distinct points of the quadrant. -/

/-! ### The Legendre conjugate

Rockafellar, p. 256. For a differentiable real-valued `f` on an open set `C ⊆ ℝⁿ`, the **Legendre
conjugate** of `(C, f)` is the pair `(D, g)` where `D = ∇f(C)` and

```
g(x*) = ⟨(∇f)⁻¹(x*), x*⟩ − f((∇f)⁻¹(x*)).
```

`∇f` need not be one-to-one for `g` to be well defined; it suffices that `⟨x, x*⟩ − f(x)` be the
same for every `x` with `∇f x = x*`, which is Theorem 26.4's first clause. -/

real trace *is* Rockafellar's `∇f`. -/

**Only convexity is needed.** The book states the theorem for a closed proper convex `f` with
non-empty `C = int (dom f)` on which `f` is differentiable; the well-definedness is a consequence of
Theorem 23.5 at the two points separately and holds wherever two gradients happen to agree. -/

a **convex function of Legendre type** (p. 258). Since `C = int (dom f)` is determined by `f`, this
is the backbone's `LegendreType f`, which by Corollary 26.3.1 holds exactly when `∂f` is
one-to-one. -/

/-! ### Lemma 26.7 -/

/-- **Rockafellar, Lemma 26.7.** Let `f` be a differentiable convex function on `ℝⁿ`. In order that
`f` be co-finite, it is necessary and sufficient that `|∇f(xᵢ)| → +∞` for every sequence with
`|xᵢ| → +∞`. -/
