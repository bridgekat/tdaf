# Rockafellar, §21: Helly's Theorem and Systems of Inequalities

Existence theorems for systems of convex inequalities, stated as pairs of mutually exclusive
alternatives, and the four forms of Helly's theorem that come out of them.

All ten numbered results of §21 are formalized over `Rn n = ℝⁿ`: Theorems 21.1–21.6 and
Corollaries 21.3.1, 21.3.2, 21.6.1, 21.6.2, together with the unnumbered exercise after Corollary
21.3.2 (`helly_recession_iff_exists_isBounded`). Theorems 21.1, 21.2 and 21.3 read "one and only
one of the following alternatives holds": `theorem_21_k` is the disjunction, the half with content,
and `theorem_21_k_exclusive` says the alternatives cannot both hold.

A **system of convex inequalities** is `fᵢ(x) ≤ αᵢ` for `i ∈ I₁` together with `fᵢ(x) < αᵢ` for
`i ∈ I₂`, with arbitrary index sets and `-∞ ≤ αᵢ ≤ +∞`. That data is `ConvexSystem`, its solution
set `ConvexSystem.solutions`, and the book's "consistent" `ConvexSystem.Consistent`. Every numbered
theorem is stated with right-hand sides `0`, which `solutions_normalize` justifies.

Two hypotheses look like slips and are not. **Theorem 21.1 asks `dom fᵢ ⊇ ri C`, not
`dom fᵢ ⊇ C`**: separation produces the inequality only where every `fᵢ` is finite, and Corollary
7.3.3 carries it from `ri C` to `cl C ⊇ C`. **Alternative (b) is read in `EReal`, where
`0 · (+∞) = 0`**; without that convention a vanishing multiplier could not drop a constraint whose
`fᵢ` is `+∞` somewhere, and Corollary 21.6.2, which extends a short multiplier vector by zeros,
would be false as stated. No `0⁺` bookkeeping appears in this section.

The "Corollary 21.3.3" cited in the book's Comments and References for Part IV does not exist; the
intended reference is Corollary 21.3.2, Helly's theorem.

with `fᵢ(x) < αᵢ` for `i ∈ I₂`, with `I₁`, `I₂` arbitrary and `-∞ ≤ αᵢ ≤ +∞`. Convexity of the `fᵢ`
is not a field: the book's own statements about the solution set carry it as a hypothesis. -/

(b) `λ₁f₁(x) + ⋯ + λ_mf_m(x) ≥ 0` for every `x ∈ C`, for some `λᵢ ≥ 0` not all zero.

This is the disjunction; `theorem_21_1_exclusive` is the exclusivity. The hypothesis is `ri C` and
not `C`, and the weighted sum is read in `EReal`, where `0 · (+∞) = 0`. -/

/-- **Theorem 21.2**. For `C` convex, `f₁, …, f_k` proper convex with `dom fᵢ ⊇ ri C`, and
`f_{k+1}, …, f_m` affine with `f_{k+1}(x) ≤ 0, …, f_m(x) ≤ 0` solvable in `ri C`, one and only one
of the following holds:

(a) `x ∈ C` with `f₁(x) < 0, …, f_k(x) < 0` and `f_{k+1}(x) ≤ 0, …, f_m(x) ≤ 0`;

(b) non-negative `λ₁, …, λ_m`, at least one of `λ₁, …, λ_k` non-zero, with
`λ₁f₁(x) + ⋯ + λ_mf_m(x) ≥ 0` for every `x ∈ C`.

The convex constraints are indexed by `ι` and the affine ones by `κ`, the latter as `Rn n →ᵃ[ℝ] ℝ`.
Theorem 21.1 is the case `κ = Empty` but is not derived from this one: 21.1 needs only Theorem
11.3, while 21.2 needs the polyhedral separation of Theorem 20.2. -/

/-- **Theorem 21.3**. Let `{fᵢ | i ∈ I}` be closed proper convex functions on `ℝⁿ`, `I` arbitrary,
and `C` a non-empty closed convex set; assume the `fᵢ` have no common direction of recession which
also recedes in `C`. Then one and only one of the following holds:

(a) `x ∈ C` with `fᵢ(x) ≤ 0` for every `i ∈ I`;

(b) non-negative `λᵢ`, finitely many non-zero, and `ε > 0` with `∑ᵢ λᵢfᵢ(x) ≥ ε` for every `x ∈ C`.

In case (b) at most `n + 1` of the `λᵢ` need be non-zero, which is the `t.card ≤ n + 1` clause. -/

/-! ### Theorem 21.6 and its corollaries: finite collections -/

/-- **Theorem 21.6**. For a *finite* collection of convex sets in `ℝⁿ`, not necessarily closed, if
every subcollection of `n + 1` or fewer sets has non-empty intersection then so does the whole
collection. Rockafellar derives this from Corollary 21.3.2; the proof here goes through Radon's
theorem instead, so Corollaries 21.6.1 and 21.6.2 do not depend on Theorem 21.3. -/

/-- **Corollary 21.6.1**. For a system `f₁(x) < 0, …, f_k(x) < 0, f_{k+1}(x) ≤ 0, …, f_m(x) ≤ 0`
with every `fᵢ` convex on `ℝⁿ`: if every subsystem of `n + 1` or fewer inequalities has a solution
in a convex set `C`, the whole system has one in `C`. The book's `1, …, k` is the index type `ι`
and its `k+1, …, m` is `κ`, so "`n + 1` or fewer inequalities" is `S.card + T.card ≤ n + 1`. -/

/-- **Corollary 21.6.2**. If alternative (b) of Theorem 21.1 holds, the `λᵢ` may be chosen with at
most `n + 1` of them non-zero. The sparsity is stated as a `Finset` `S` of size at most `n + 1`
outside which every `λᵢ` vanishes, which avoids deciding `λᵢ ≠ 0`; extending a short multiplier
vector by zeros is harmless precisely because `0 · (+∞) = 0` in `EReal`. The book states this for
Theorem 21.2 as well — that half is `corollary_21_6_2_affine`. -/

/-- **Corollary 21.6.2** for **Theorem 21.2**: if alternative (b) holds there, at most `n + 1` of
`λ₁, …, λ_m` need be non-zero, the count running over the affine multipliers as well as the convex
ones, since the book's `λ₁, …, λ_m` is one list. The book's proof, verbatim: if (a) fails it
already fails for a subsystem of at most `n + 1` inequalities, and Theorem 21.2 applied to that
subsystem produces multipliers which extend by zero. -/
