# Rockafellar, §39: Convex Processes

A **convex process** from `ℝᵐ` to `ℝⁿ` is a multivalued map whose graph is a convex cone containing
the origin. It sits between a linear transformation and a convex bifunction, and it inherits a full
duality theory from §§30–38. All nine numbered results of §39 are formalized: Theorems 39.1–39.8
and Corollary 39.7.1.

## Implementation notes

**Orientation is data, not a convention.** Rockafellar is explicit: "an oriented convex set is a
pair consisting of a convex set and one of the words *supremum* or *infimum*". Theorems 39.5 and
39.8 require two processes to carry the **same** orientation and Theorem 39.2 **flips** it, so both
orientations have to be simultaneously expressible: a global convention of the kind §36 imposes on
saddle-functions cannot even state Theorem 39.5. Hence `Orientation`, `OrientedProcess` and the
dispatch `Orientation.adjointProcess`.

`PolyhedralConvexProcess` is a surface definition; no numbered result of §39 needs it.

## Divergences from the book

Theorem 39.1 is stated with `A 0 = {0}` where the book assumes `A 0` bounded. The first line of
Rockafellar's proof turns one into the other and nothing later uses boundedness, so `A 0 = {0}` is
the hypothesis the theorem actually has, and it needs neither a norm nor finite dimension;
`theorem_39_1_isBounded` recovers the book's literal form.

Theorems 39.5, 39.7 and 39.8 carry an `IsExactSum` where the book carries a relative-interior
condition. `IsExactSum` demands **proper** summands, and the summands here are `u ↦ -⟨Aᵢ u, x*⟩`,
which take `-∞` wherever `Aᵢ u` is unbounded in the direction `x*`; quantified over all `x*` that
forces `dom Aᵢ* = ℝⁿ`. The hypothesis is therefore strictly stronger than the book's — strong
enough to exclude §39's own running example `Au = {x | x ≤ Bu}` for `u ≥ 0` — and the gap is not
closable by `IsExactSum.of_relint`.

Theorem 39.3's last assertion is stated without closedness on the `u` side, where the book prefixes
both halves with "if `A` is closed": that half is Corollary 33.2.1.

/-- **Theorem 39.8**, second statement, first half: for closed `A` and `B`, `BA` is closed. Where
the book asks that `ri (range B*)` meet `ri (dom A*)`, the hypothesis here is again an
