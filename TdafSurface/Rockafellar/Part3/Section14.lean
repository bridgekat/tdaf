# Rockafellar, §14: Polars of Convex Sets

The polar `K°` of a convex cone and the polar `C°` of a convex set, the bipolar theorems, and the
duality between gauges and support functions that polarity carries. All 11 numbered results of §14
are formalized.

## The section's definitions

* **The polar of a convex cone** `K° = {x* | ⟨x, x*⟩ ≤ 0 for every x ∈ K}` is the backbone's
  `polarCone (pairing n)`, unfolded here as `mem_polarCone_rn`.
* **The polar of a convex set** `C° = {x* | ⟨x, x*⟩ ≤ 1 for every x ∈ C}` is
  `polarSet (pairing n)`, unfolded as `mem_polarSet_rn`. The two agree on cones
  (`polarCone_eq_polarSet_rn`, the remark following Corollary 14.5.1).
* **Rank** of a convex set is `rankSet C = dim C - lineality C`, defined here because
  Corollary 14.6.1 is its first consumer among sets; §13's `rankFn` is the companion for functions.
* **The triples of `ℝⁿ⁺²`** that Theorem 14.4 is stated in are `triple λ x μ`, the concatenation
  `(λ, x, μ)`, and `endsReflection` is the book's `(λ*, x*, μ*) ↦ (-μ*, x*, -λ*)` read through it.

Theorems 14.1 and 14.5 carry no `Proof.` paragraph in the book, each summarising the running text
before it; both arguments are recovered here. `polarCone_polarCone` is proved by the separation
route the book mentions as an alternative (Corollary 11.7.1), and `C°° = C` by the same argument
with the constant normalised to `1`.

The unnumbered running text is recorded too: `(cl K)° = K°` and `K°° = cl K` for an arbitrary
bundled cone; the polar of a subspace as its orthogonal complement, of the non-negative orthant as
the non-positive orthant, and of a generated cone as the solution set of `⟨aᵢ, x*⟩ ≤ 0`; that
polarity is order-inverting; and that `C° = D°` for `D = cl (conv (C ∪ {0}))`, whence
`C°° = cl (conv (C ∪ {0}))` — which is what makes Theorem 14.5's hypotheses exactly the right ones.

/-! ### Theorem 14.3

Rockafellar's hypothesis `f(0) > 0 > inf f` is self-dual: `f*(0) = -inf f` and `inf f* = -f(0)`
(`conj_apply_zero`, `iInf_conj_eq_neg_apply_zero`), so `f*(0) > 0 > inf f*` as well. -/

/-! ### Theorem 14.4

`K` is the convex cone in `ℝⁿ⁺²` generated by the `(1, x, μ)` with `μ ≥ f(x)`, and `K*` the same
cone built from `f*`. The theorem reads the conjugate of `f` off the polar of `K` — conjugacy from
polarity, the direction opposite to the rest of §14. The mathematics lives in `ℝ × ℝⁿ × ℝ`, where
the cone is `homCone f`; `triple` concatenates that space into `ℝⁿ⁺²`. -/

`rankFn` is the companion for convex functions. -/
noncomputable def rankSet (C : Set (Rn n)) : ℤ := dim C - (lineality C : ℤ)

/-- **Corollary 14.6.1**, first relation: `dim C° = n - lineality C` for a closed
convex set `C` containing the origin.

`dim` is §1's, and the affine hull of `C°` is a subspace because `0 ∈ C°`. -/

/-- **Theorem 14.7**, first assertion: if `f` is non-negative and vanishes at the origin, then
`f*` is likewise non-negative. -/

/-- **Theorem 14.7**, first inclusion: `{x | f x ≤ α}° ⊆ α⁻¹ {x* | f* x* ≤ α}` for
`0 < α < ∞`.

Stated without the closedness the book assumes: one inclusion is a rescaling into the level set,
the other is Fenchel's inequality, and neither uses it. -/
