# Rockafellar, §36: Minimax Problems

The two iterated extrema `sup inf` and `inf sup`, the saddle-value and the saddle-point, the
reduction of a minimax problem on `C × D` to one on all of `ℝᵐ × ℝⁿ`, the inverse bifunction `F_*`,
and the identification of the Lagrangians of closed convex programs with the upper closed
concave-convex functions. All seven numbered results of §36 are formalized: Lemmas 36.1 and 36.2,
Theorems 36.3–36.6 and Corollary 36.3.1.

**Orientation.** From here to the end of the book, *minimization takes place in the convex argument
and maximization in the concave one*. For a concave-convex `K (u, v)` — concave in the first
argument, convex in the second — that fixes both extrema: `maximin K` is `sup_u inf_v K (u, v)` and
`minimax K` is `inf_v sup_u K (u, v)`, so Lemma 36.1 reads `maximin K ≤ minimax K`, and a
saddle-point is a `p` with `K (u, p.2) ≤ K p ≤ K (p.1, v)` — first argument maximised, second
minimised. Theorems 36.3–36.6 and every result of §37 are false verbatim under the opposite
convention.

`HasSaddleValue` is the bare equality of the two iterated extrema. Finiteness of the common value
is a separate conclusion, drawn where the book draws it, in Corollary 36.3.1.

section Defs

variable {m n : ℕ}

/-- The two iterated extrema, and the **saddle-value** of `K` — their common value, *when they are
equal*. Nothing is said about that value being finite. -/
theorem hasSaddleValue_iff_maximin_eq (K : Rn m × Rn n → EReal) :
    HasSaddleValue K ↔ (⨆ u : Rn m, ⨅ v : Rn n, K (u, v)) = ⨅ v : Rn n, ⨆ u : Rn m, K (u, v) :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- The definition of a **saddle-point**: `K (u, v̄) ≤ K (ū, v̄) ≤ K (ū, v)` for all `u` and `v`.
The first argument is the one `K` is maximised over. -/
theorem isSaddlePoint_iff_forall (K : Rn m × Rn n → EReal) (p : Rn m × Rn n) :
    IsSaddlePoint K p ↔ ∀ u : Rn m, ∀ v : Rn n, K (u, p.2) ≤ K p ∧ K p ≤ K (p.1, v) :=
  ⟨fun h u v => ⟨h.1 u, h.2 v⟩, fun h => ⟨fun u => (h u 0).1, fun v => (h 0 v).2⟩⟩

theorem lemma_36_1 (K : Rn m × Rn n → EReal) : maximin K ≤ minimax K :=
  maximin_le_minimax K

/-- **Lemma 36.1** in the book's own `C × D` form, for arbitrary subsets `C` and `D`. The `⨆ ∈`
reading makes the book's nonemptiness assumption unnecessary. -/

/-- **Lemma 36.2**: `(ū, v̄)` is a saddle-point exactly when the supremum in `sup inf` is attained
at `ū`, the infimum in `inf sup` at `v̄`, and the two extrema are equal. Stated on `ℝᵐ × ℝⁿ` rather
than the book's `C × D`; `IsSaddlePointOn` carries the relative reading where it is wanted. -/

`dom K`. The book states this for a *closed* proper saddle-function; closedness is not used. -/

`F_*^*` for either. The left side is the concave adjoint of the concave bifunction `F_*`, the right
